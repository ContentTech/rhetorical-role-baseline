Udai U. Lalit and C.K. Ratnaparkhi for the Appellants. P.K. Goswami, P.H. Parekh and Sunil Dogra for the Re- spondents. The Judgement of the Court was delivered by KULDIP SINGH,J. These appeals are directed against the judgement of the Nagpur Bench of Bombay High Court directing the ejectment of the appellants from three tracts of agri- cultural-land which the appellants are in cultivating pos- session since 1951. Respondent Bhikaji is the owner of about 20 acres of land subject-matter of the dispute. The said land is in cultivating possession of the appellants since 1951 and according to them, they have acquired the status of protect- ed lessees under the Berar Regulation of Agricultural Leases Act, 1951(hereinafter called `the Berar Act') and the Bombay Tenancy and agricultural Lands (Vidarbha Region)Act, 1958 (hereinafter called `the Bombay Act') The respondent Bhikaji initiated proceedings before the Sub-Divisional Officer Buldana for ejectment of the appel- lants on the ground that predecessor of the first appellants created sub-leases infavour of second appellant and one Zipra Wanchu and as such their tenancy was liable to be terminated in terms of Section 8(1)(c)(f) of the Berar Act. Bhikaji filed two seperate applications against the appel- lants. The applications were resisted by the appellants inter alia on the ground that all the three persons, namely, Pundlik Krishna, Kashao Krishna and Zipra Wanchhu were inde- pendent lessees in their own rights and as such there was no question of Pundlik Krishnaji having created sub-leases infavour of the other two. Before the Sub-Divisional Officer, the respondent Bhikaji produced a lease deed dated April 30, 1951 to prove that all the three tracts of land were leased to late Pundlik Krishnaji and no part of the land was ever leased to Keshao Krishnaji and Zipra Wanchhu. It was sought to be shown from the lease deed that the original lessee Pundlik Krishnaji sub-leased part of the land to the other two occupants. The Sub-Divisional Officer accepted the contention of the respondent and ordered the ejectment of the appellants. The Sub-Divisional Officer proceeded on the following reasoning:- ``The contention of the defendant numbers 1 and 2 that the lease of the remaining half share of the suit land was created by the plaintiff's brother Keshav Bhikaji with the defendant numbers 2 and 3 has no force...... The defendant numbers 1 and 2 contend that the original lease deed dated 30.4.51 is a forged one, but they have failed to mention this fact in all their written statements or to show any reason when questioned by the plaintiff's counsel..... Pundlik Krishnaji and Keshao Krishnaji went in appeal before the Sub-Deputy Collector against the order of the Sub-Divisional Officer. The Collector dismissed the appeals. Regarding the lease deed relied upon by the respondent Bhikaji, the Collector observed as under:- ``The very fact that the appellant Pundlik executed a lease deed of all these fields in favour of respondent Trimbak goes to prove that he was the Karta of the family and his brother Keshao had no hand in the management on leasing out the property...... The execution of lease deed dated 30.4.51 by appellant Pundlik in favour of the respondent Trimbak has been admitted by the appellants...... On the other hand there is document ``Lease Deed'' dated 30.4.51 which clearly shows that appellant Pundlik was the sole lessee of the fields in question. I, therefore, agree with the finding of the lower court that appellant Pundlik was a tenant of the fields in ques- tion.'' The tenants further went in revision before the Revenue Tribunal. The Tribunal set aside the orders of the Sub-Divisional Officer and of the Sub-Collector and dismissed the ejectment applications of the respondent-landlord. The Tribunal no- ticed the arguments of the appellants-tenants in the follow- ing words:- ``Feeling aggrieved by this order, applicants filed two separate appeals. In their appeals, they urged that neither Keshao nor Zipra Wanchhu was the sub- tenant of the fields in question. Pundlik had not sublet the fields to them. The alleged lease deed dated 30.4.51 was a forged document and adverse inference against them should not have been drawn for their failure to plead that the document dated 30.4.51 was a forged one as the same was produced after written statements by the applicants were already filed. Zipra Wanchhu was colluding with landholder Trimbak Bhikaji and the story put up, by him should have been discarded.... The Tribunal finally held as under:- ``It has been contended by the applicants that the lease deed of 30.4.51 was a forgery. This contention of the applicants had not been inquired into upon the short ground that it was not made in the written statements of the applicants. The applicants say that the lease deed dated 30.4.51 was filed after their written statements. It is true that they could have amended their written statements so as to allege forgery of the lease deed dated 30.4.51 when the same was filed. None- the-less, it appears to me that the contention of forgery should have been inquired into when the same was made by the applicants. It has been the case of applicants that Pundlik was the lessee of half of the share in the fields survey numbers, whereas applicant number 2 keshao Krishnaji and Zipra Wanchhu cultivated as the lessee of the other half of the fields. They never said that they were the lessees under any lease-deed. It was, therefore, necessary to find out as to whether the lease deed dated 30.4.51 was genuine or forged document. In the result, applications made by Trimbak Bhikaji alone without joining keshao Bhikaji, who was a necessary party to the applications, are rejected.'' The tenant challenged the order of the Tribunal by way of two petitions under Article 227 of the Constitution of India before the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court. The order of the Tribunal dated March 25,1970 was challenged in the High Court on August 4, 1971. In order to get over the delay in filing the writ petition counsel for the land-owner filed an affidavit stating that the papers in his office remained unattended due to oversight and pressure of work and as such the filing of the petitions was delayed.The High Court allowed the petitions on the following grounds:- (1) The reasons for not filing the writ petitions dili- gently having been explained by the petitioner's advocate by filing an affidavit the petition could not be dismissed on the ground of delay and latches. (2) The Tribunal rejected the claim of the tenant- petitioner on the only ground that the original applications were bad as petitioner's brother was not joined as a party. The High Court held that ``Trimbak Bhikaji Patil being the Karta of the family could file the applications for eject- ment in that capacity.'' (3) Regarding the lease deed April 30, 1951 the High Court held as under:- ``There is one more circumstance. The lease deed that was executed in respect of the suit lands was in favour of the petitioner. It is dated 30.4.51. The lessee is respondent number 1. Thus, the relationship of the landlord and tenant came into existence between the petitioner and respondent number 1. It will not be normally open for respondent number 1 to urge that the petitioner alone is not his landlord. To get over this difficulty, it was suggested at the time of the arguments that this lease deed is forged one. The M.R.T. has considered this question in a slip-shod-manner. The point as to the alleged forgery of lease deed was not taken in the written statement by any of the respondents. In spite of that the M.R.T. has stated that the contention of forgery should have been enquired into. I am not able to accept this reasoning par- ticularly when the Niab Tahsildar and the S.D.O. have accepted the lease deed as genuine one.'' (4) Under the Berar Act, before initiating ejectment proceedings, no notice was required to be sent to the tenant but under the Bombay Act there is requirement of the notice. It was argued on behalf of the tenant that since in the year 1958. The Bombay Act had come into force repealing the Berar Act and the proceedings, though initiated under the Berar Act, were deemed to be under the Bombay Act, and because no prior notice as required by the Bombay Act was given, the proceedings were bad in law. The High Court rejected the argument on the ground that the proceedings having already been initiated under the Berar Act no notice was necessary and the proceedings were rightly taken to be under the Bombay Act. The High Court allowed the petition and set aside the order of the Tribunal. It is these circumstances that these in appeals by the tenants by way of special leave petitions are before us. We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length. We are of the view of that the High Court was not justified in reaching the conclusion that the lease deed dated April 30, 1951 was a genuine document. The Tribunal allowed the tenant's revision on the fol- lowing grounds:- (1) The land in question belonged to the two brothers jointly. The applications for ejectment were filed only by Trimbak Bhikaji. The other brother had not made the applica- tions for terminating the tenancy either separately or by joining his brother. The Tribunal came to the conclusion that the applications by Trimbak Bhikaji alone were not competent and on this ground the Tribunal rejected the applications. (2) The Tribunal after examining the pleadings and the evidence on the record came to the conclusion that the Courts below should have enquired into the genuineness of the lease deed. The Tribunal reached the finding ``it was, therefore, necessary to find out as to whether the lease deed dated 30.4.51 was genuine or forged document.'' A bare reading of the Tribunal's order shows that the Tribunal granted relief to the appellant-tenant on the above two grounds. We are of the view that the High Court was justified in setting aside the Tribunbal's finding on the first point mentioned above. The High Court found that Trimbak Bhikaji being the Karta of the family could file the applications for termination of the tenancy without associ- ating his brother. We see no infirmity in the said finding of the High Court. The High Court was also right in rejecting the contention of the tenant that the proceedings under the Bombay Act were ille- gal as the requirement of prior notice under the said Act was not complied with. We are, however, of the view that the High Court erred in holding that the lease deed dated April 30, 1951 was a genuine document. No enquiry was held at any stage regarding the genuineness of the lease deed. The Sub- Divisional Officer refused to go into the question on the ground that there were no pleadings on the point. The Sub- Divisional Officer was obviously wrong because the lease deed was filed by the respondent-land-owner after the plead- ings were completed. The Appellate Court was wholly unjusti- fied in observing that the appellants-tenants had admitted the execution of the lease deed. The appellant's case throughout had been that the lease deed was a forged docu- ment. The Tribunal could not remand the case for enquiry into the genuineness of the lease deed because it had allowed the revisions on two grounds. The High Court, having reversed the finding of the Tribunal on the first point, should have remanded the case to the Trial Court for determining the genuineness of the lease deed dated April 30, 1951 specially when the case of the respondent-land-owner was wholly based on the said document. The High Court had no material before it to come to the conclusion that the lease deed was a genuine document. We, therefore, set aside the High Court judgement and also of the Courts below and remand the case to the con- cerned trial court for deciding the ejectment applications filed by the respondent-land-owner afresh after affording opportunity to the parties in accordance with law. The trial court shall afford full opportunity to the parties to pro- duce evidence on the issue of the genuineness or otherwise of the lease deed dated April 30, 1951. The appeals are allowed in the above terms with no order as to costs. V.P.R. Appeals allowed."}, "annotations": [{"result": [{"value": {"start": 0, "end": 192, "text": "CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION :Civil Appeal number 349-50 of 1978 From the Judgement and Order dated 10.8.1977 of the Bombay High Court in Special Civil Application numbers 230 and 235 of 1972.", "labels": ["NONE"]}}, {"value": {"start": 193, "end": 247, "text": "Udai U.

From the Judgment and Order dated 13.11.91 of the Madras High Court in O.S.A. number 191 of 1988, O.P. number 230/84 and Application number 3505 of 1984 and dated 27.1.1992 in O.S.A. number 9 of 1992. WITH Special Leave Petition number 9408 of 1992. A.K. Sen, A.T.M. Sampath and Sitharanjandas for the Appellants. T.S.K. Iyer, S. Sivasubramaniam, R. Thamodharan, Dr. A.F. Julian (For M/s Arputham, Aruna & Co.) and A. Mariarputham for the Respondents. The following Judgment of the Court was delivered by AHMADI, J. The four appellants and respondents 1 and 2 are brothers. They were carrying on business in partnership in the name and style of Messers Sivalinga Nadar and Brothers and S.versus Oil Mills, both partnerships being registered under the Partnership Act, 1932. Most of the properties were acquired by the firm of Sivalinag Nadar and Brothers. The firm of Messers S.versus Oil Mills merely had leasehold rights in the parcel of land belonging to the first-named firm on which the superstructure of the oil miff stood. Both the partnerships were of fixed durations. Disputes arose between the six brothers in regard to the business carried on 'in partnership in the aforesaid two names. For the resolution of these disputes the six brothers entered into an arbitration agreement dated 8th October, 1981, which was as under : \"We are carrying on business in Partnership together with other partners under several partnership names. We are also holding shares and Managing the Public Limited Company, namely. The Madras Vanaspati Ltd., at Villupuram. Disputes have arisen among us with respect to the several business concerns, immoveable and moveable properties standing in our names as well as other relatives. We are hereby referring all our disputes, the details of which would be given by us shortly to you, namely, Sri B.B. Naidu, Sri K.R. Ramamani and Sri Seatharaman. We agree to abide by your award as to our disputes.\" All the three arbitrators were fairly well-conversant with the business carried on in different names by the aforesaid two partnership firms; the first two being their Tax Consultants and the third being their Chartered Accountant. The parties, therefore, had complete faith and trust in their objectivity and impartiality The arbitrators accepted and entered upon the reference and after giving the disputants full and complete opportunity to place their rival points of view before them, circulated a draft award and after considering the response and reaction of the disputants thereon made their final award on 9th July, 1984. The concluding part of the award reads as under : \"We hereby direct that each of the parties be allotted the schedule of properties mentioned in the various schedules A to F annexed to this award. 1. S.V. Sivalinga Nadar- Schedule 'A' 2. S.V. Harikrishnan- Schedule 'B' 3. S.V. Chandrapandian- Schedule 'C' 4. S.V. Kasilingam Schedule 'D' 5. S.V. Ramchandran- Schedule 'E' 6. S.V. Natesan Schedule 'F We direct that the firms of M/s Sivalinga Nadar & Bros. and M/s S.versus Oil Mills and also the joint house property Rent Account be dissolved as at the close of business on 14th July, 1984.\" The arbitrators then proceed to set out the properties belonging to or claimed to belong to the aforesaid two firms in paragraphs 6 to 24 of their award. Paragraph 25 is 'a residuary clause which says that any asset left out or realised hereafter or any liability found due other than those reflected in the account books, shall, likewise, be divided and/or borne equally among the disputants. Paragraphs 26 and 27 deal with the use of the firm names. Paragraph 28 refers to the claim of Shrimati C. Kanthimathi, sister of the six partners, with which we are not concerned in these appeals. Paragraph 29 refers to the business carried on by the relatives of the disputants in the names of Sri Brahmasakthi Agency and Srimagal Finance Corporation. The arbitrators have recognised the fact that even though the said business is not carried on by the disputants it would be desirable to dissolve the said firms also we.f. 24th July, 1984 in the larger interest of peace and amity among the disputants and their relatives. Paragraph 30 refers to the properties standing in the name of the father of the six disputants, i.e., partners of the two firms in question. It is stated that although initially the disputants had shown an inclination to refer the dispute concerning the properties owned by their father to the arbitration of the three arbitrators but when it was noticed that the deceased had left a will disposing of the properties the need for resolution of the dispute through arbitration did not survive. In paragraph 31 the arbitrators have determined their fees and have directed the disputants to bear them equally. At the end of the award the properties falling to the share of the disputants have been set out in detail in Schedules A to F referred to earlier. After the award was made on 9th July, 1984, O.P. number 230 of 1984 was filed by S.V. Chandrapandian & ORS for a direction to the arbitrators to file their award in Court which was done. Thereupon, the applicants S.V. Chanrapandian and others filed a Miscellaneous Application number 3503 of 1984 requesting the Court to pass a decree in terms of the award. Before orders could be passed on that application, O.P. numbers 247 & 275 of 1984 werefiled by S.V. Sivalinga Nadar and S.V. Harikrishnan respectively under section 30 of the Arbitration Act to set aside the award. The said applications came up for hearing before a learned Single Judge of the High Court. Various points were raised and decided by the learned Single Judge but it would be sufficient for our purpose to refer to the one which we are called upon to decide in these group of appeals. That is to be found in paragraph 71 of the judgment of the learned Single Judge. The contention urged was that having regard to the allotment of partnership properties under the award, it was incumbent that the award should have been registered as required by Section 17(1) of the Registration Act and since it lacked registration, the Court had no jurisdiction to make it the rule of the Court and grant a decree in terms thereof. The learned Single Judge answered the aforesaid contention in paragraph 72 of his judgment as under : \"The learned counsel for the respondents also contended that Award falls under Schedule I Article 12 of the Stamp Act and the allocation of properties owned by partnership firm on dissolution to the erstwhile partners is not partition of immoveable properties. In this connection, learned counsel for the respondents placed reliance in the decision reported in AIR 1959 Andhra Pradesh P.380 (FB) which decision has been confirmed in AIR 1966 SC 1300 = 1966 (2) MLJ 60 SC. Addanki Narayanappa V. Bhaskara Kiishnappa. It was submitted by the learned counsel for the respondents that the contentions with regard to stamp and registration put forward by the petitioner cannot be accepted. It is to be pointed out that the Award has been submitted for registration long ago on 27-10.1984 itself and it is stamped and if there is any deficiency, the Registering Authority could direct proper stamp to be affixed and therefore I feel there could be no impediment for the Award being made a rule of the Court and a decree being passed in terms of the Award as contended by the learned counsel for the respondents.\" The learned Single Judge thereafter proceeded to make the final order in paragraph 78 of the judgment in the following terms : \"Thus on a careful consideration of the materials available and the contentions of either side it has to be decided that Application number 3505 of 1984 in O.P. number 230/84 filed by the petitioners therein praying for a decree in terms of the arbitration Award dated 9.7.1984 has to be allowed and O.P. numbers 247 and 275 of 1984 and the application filed in. those two petitions, i.e., Application numbers 3474, 3476, 5030, 5031, 5032, 2827, 2828,3773, 3762, 3874 of 1984 and 4886 and 4887 of 1985, are dismissed. The petitioner in O P. number 230/84 and the applicants in Application number 3503/84 are directed to take steps for getting the Award registered. The parties in all these proceedings are directed to bear their own costs.\" It may here be mentioned that after the making of the award one of the arbitrators Sri B.B. Naidu passed away on 20th October, 1984. At the request of some of the parties the surviving arbitrators presented the award before the District Registrar, Madras, for registration on 27.10.84. Even though. the signature of the deceased arbitrator was identified by the surviving arbitrators the document was kept pending for registration. In the meantime, on 23rd January, 1987, advocate for Sivalinga Nadar served notice on the Registrar not to register the document and threatened to take proceedings in Court if the document was registered. It will thus be seen that the registration of the document was blocked by one of the disputants Sivalinga Nadar on the premise that the High Court had in O.P. number 247/84 granted a stay against the operation of the award on 5th September, 1984. Against the judgment of the learned Single Judge, the matter was carried in appeal to a Division Bench of the High Court of Madras. The Division Bench of the High Court reversed the aforesaid finding recorded by the learned Single Judge and came to the conclusion that the award required registration under section 17(1) of the Registration Act. In this view that it took, it did not think it necessary to go into the other contentions dealt with by the learned Single Judge. It held that since the award required registration and was in fact not registered no proceeding for making the award the rule of the Court could be entertained because in the absence of a valid award the Court had no jurisdiction to grant a decree in term of the award. It, however, took note of the fact that the award was presented for registration but on account of the conduct of one of the disputants it could not be registered as the Registering Authority was threatened with civil consequences. The correspondence in this behalf wassought to be placed on record as additional evidence but the Division Bench though that would not alter the situation since the fact remained that the award was not registered even on the dated of its judgment. It, therefore, made the following observation in paragraph 46 of the judgment: \"It, however, does not mean that if the award is validly registered and presented to be made a rule of the Court in accordance with law, the Court cannot entertain the same.\" In this view of the matter the Division Bench allowed the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment of the learned Single Judge and held that as the award was not registered it could not be made the rule of the Court. It made no order as to costs. It is against this decision of the Division Bench of the High Court that present appeals by special leave (we also grant special leave in S.L.P. number 9408 of 1992) have been filed. Before we examine the contention based on section 17 of the Registration Act we may notice a few relevant provisions bearing on the interest of partners in partnership property as found in the Partnership Act, 1932. Section 4 defines partnership a,-, a relationship between persons who have agreed to share the profit of a business carried on by all or any of them acting for all. Section 14 provides that subject to contract between the partners, the property of the firm includes all property and rights and interests in property originally brought into the stock of the firm, or acquired, by purchase or otherwise, by or for the firm, or for the purposes and in the course of the business of the firm, and includes also the goodwill of the business. It is also clarified that unless the contrary intention appears, property and rights and interest in property acquired with money belonging to the firm shall be deemed to have been acquired for the firm. Section 15 says that the property of the firm shall be held and used by the partners exclusively for the purposes of the business subject of course to contract between the partners. Says section 18, subject to the provisions of the Act, a partner is the agent of the firm for the purposes of the business of the firm. Under section 19 the act of a partner which is done to carry on, in the usual way, business of the kind carried on by the firm, shall bind the firm. This authority to bind the firm is termed as \"implied authority\". Section 22 lays down that in order to bind a firm, an act or instrument done or executed by a partner or other person on behalf of the firm shall bedone or executed in the firm name, or in any other manner expressing or implying an intention to bind the firm. Section 29 deals with the rights of transferee of a partner's interest. Sub-section (1) thereof provides that such a transferee will not have the same rights as the transferor-partner but he would be entitled to receive the share of profits of his transferor on the account of profits agreed to by the partners. Sub-section (2) next provides that upon dissolution of the firm or upon a transferor- partner ceasing to be a partner, the transferee would be entitled against the remaining partners to receive the share of the assets of the firm to which the transferor-partner was entitled and will also be entitled to an account as from the date of dissolution. Section 30 deals with the case of a minor admitted to the, benefits of partnership. Such a minor is given a right to his share of the property of the firm and also a right to share in the profits of the firm as may be agreed upon business share is made liable for the acts of the firm though he would not be personally liable for the same. Sub-section (4), however, debars a minor from suing the partners for an account or for his share of the property or profits of the firm except when he severe his connections with the firm, in which case for determining his share the law requires a valuation of his share in the property of the firm to be made in accordance with Section 48. Sections 31 to 38 relate to incoming and outgoing partners. Section 32 deals with the consequences of retirement. Sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 32 deal with the consequences of retirement while Sections 36 and 37 speak about the rights of an outgoing partner to carry on competing business and in certain cases to share subsequent profits. Chapter VI deals with the dissolution of a firm. Section 40 provides that a firm may be dissolved with the consent of all the partners or in accordance with the contract between the partners. Sections 41 and 42 deal with dissolution on the happening of certain events while Section 43 permits a partner to dissolve a firm by notice if it is a partnership at will. Section 44 speaks of dissolution through Court. Section 48 indicates the mode of settlement of accounts between the partners on dissolution while Section 49 posits that where there are joint debts due from the firm, and also separate debts due from any partner, the property of the firm shall be applied in the first instance in payment of the debts of the firm, and, if there is any surplus, then the share of each partner shall be applied in payment of his separate debts or paid to him. The separate property of any partner shall be applied first in the payment of his separate debts, and thesurplus (if any) in the payment of the debts of the firm. Chapter VII deals with the registration of firm, etc,. and Chapter VIII contains the saving clause. The above provisions make it clear that regardless of the character of the property brought in by the partners on the constitution of the partnership firm or that which is acquired in the course of business of the partnership, such property shall become the property of the firm and an individual partner shall only be entitled to his share of profits, if any, accruing to the partnership from the realisation of this property and upon dissolution of the partnership to a share in the money representing the value of the property. It is well-settled that the firm is not a legal entity, it has no legal existence, it is merely a compendious name and hence the partnership property would vest in all the partners of the firm. Accordingly, each and every partner of the firm would have an interest in the perperty or asset of the firm but during its subsistence no partner can deal with any portion of the property as belonging to him, nor can be assign his interest in any specific item thereof to anyone. By virtue of the implied authority conferred as agent of the firm his action would bind the firm if it is done to carry on, in the usual way, the business of the kind carried on by the firm but the act or instrument by which the firm is sought to be bound must be done or executed in the firm name or in any other manner expressing or implying an intention to bind the firm. His right is merely to obtain such profits, if any, as may fall to his share upon the dissolution of the firm which remain after satisfying the liabilities set out in the various sub- clauses (i) to (iv) of clause (b) of section 48 of the Act. In the present case the six brothers who were carrying on business in partnership fell out on account of disputes which they could not resolve inter se. The partnership being of fixed durations could not be dissolved by any partner by notice. As they could not resolve their disputes they decided to resort to arbitration. The three arbitrators chosen by them were men of their confidence and they after giving the partners full and complete opportunity took care to first circulate a proposed award to ascertain the reaction of the disputants therein. The letter written to the arbitrators by S.V. Sivalinga Nadar dated 16th February, 1983 indicates that he was quite satisfied with the hearing given by the arbitrators. He was also by and large satisfied with the proposed award but thought it warranted certain adjustments to make it acceptable and rationale. He was of the view that theaward should provide for the reallocation of the shareholdings of Madras Vanaspati Ltd., whereas Brahmaksthi Tin Factory owned by his sons should be kept out of the purview of the arbitrators since it was not the subject matter of arbitration. Then he raised some objection as to the percentage of his share and the amount found due to him. In the subsequent letter written on 9th September, 1983 he has reiterated these very objections while raising certain questions regarding valuation of partnership properties. Even the application filed under Sections 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act in the High Court the objections to the award as enumerated in paragraph 15 mainly concerned (i) the conduct of the arbitrators who, it is alleged, acted negligently, with bias and against principles of natural justice (ii) deliberate act in leaving out certain proper- ties from consideration e.g., shareholdings of Madras Vanaspati Ltd., stock-in-trade and cash deposits, the properties of Velayudha Perumal Nadar, etc., and (iii) failure to grant him a higher share to which he was entitled. No contention was raised regarding the want of registration of the award. However, being a question of law, the learned Single Judge entertained the plea and rejected it but it found favour with the Division Bench. We now think it convenient to reproduce the relevant part of Section 17 of the Registration Act :\"17(1) The following documents shall be registered, if the property to which they relate is situate in a district in which, and if they have been executed on or after the date on which, Act, number XVI of 1864, or the Indian Registration Act, 1866 (20 of 1866), or the Indian Registration Act, 1871 (8 of 1871), or the Indian Registration Act, 1877 (3 of 1877), or this Act came or comes into force, namely (a) instruments of gift of immoveable property; (b) other non-testamentary instruments which purport or operate to create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish, whether in present or in future, any right, title or interest, whether vested or contingent, of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards, to or in immoveable property; (c) non-testamentary instruments which acknowledge the receipt or payment of any consideration on account of the creation, declaration, assignment, limitation or extinction of any such right, title or interest; and (d) leases of immoveable property from year to year, or for any terms exceeding one year, or reserving a yearly rent; (e) non-testamentary instruments transferring or assigning any decree or order of a Court or any award when such decree or order or award purports or operates to create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish, whether in present or in future, any right, title or interest, whether vested or contingent, of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards, to or in immoveable property.\" The submission made in this behalf before the Courts below was that the award involved a partition of immoveable properties as a consequence of dissolution of the firms and since the value of the immoveable properties which are the subject matter of the award indisputably exceed the value of Rupees 100, the award was compulsorily registrable in view of the mandatory nature of the language of Section 17(1) which uses the expression 'shall be registered'. On the mandatory character of the provision there is no dispute. The question which requires determination is whether on the dissolution of the partnership the distribution of the assets of the firm comprising both moveable and immoveable properties after meating its obligations on settlement of accounts amongst the partners of the firm in proportion to their respective shares amounts to a partition of immoveable properties or a relinquishment or extinguishment of a share in immoveable property requiring registration under Section 17 of the Registration Act if the allocation includes immoveable property of the value of Rupees 100 and above? In other words the question to the considered is whether the interest of a partner in partnership assets is to be treated as moveable property or both moveable and immoveable depending on the character of the property for the purposes of Section 17 of the Registration Act? This question has been the subject matter of decision in a few cases. In Addanki Narayanappa & ANR v. Bhaskara Krishtappa & 13 ORS , [1966] 3 SCR 400 the members of two Joint Hindu families, the Addanki family and the Bhaskara family, had entered into partnership for carrying on business of hulling rice, etc.; each family having half share in that business. The capital of the partnership comprised, among other things, certain lands belonging to the two families. The firm acquired more lands in the course of business. Differences arose whereupon two members of the Addanki family filed a suit for dissolution of the partnership and accounts. All the members of the two families were made parties to the suit either as plaintiffs or as defendants. The Bhaskara family contended in defence that the partnership was dissolved in 1936 and accounts were settled between the two families under a karar executed in favour of Bhaskara Gurappa Setty, the karta of the Bhaskara family, by five members of the Addanki family representing that family. The defendants, therefore, contended that the plaintiffs had no cause of action and the suit for dissolution of partnership and accounts was not maintainable. The relevant part of the agreement Karar reads as under : \"As disputes have arisen in our family regarding partition, it is not possible to carry on the business of to make investment in furture. Moreover, you yourself have undertaken to discharge some of the debts payable by us in the coastal parts in connec- tion with our private business. Therefore, from this day onwards we have closed the joint business. So, from this day onwards, we have given up (our) share in the machine etc., and in the business, and we have made over the same to you alone completely by way of adjustment. You yourself shall carry on the business without ourselves having anything to do with the profit and loss. Herefor, you have given up to us the property forming our Venkatasubbayya's share which you have purchased and delivered possession of the same to us even previously. In case you want to execute and deliver a proper document in respect of the share which we have given to you, we shall at you own expense, execute and deliver a document registerd.\" Ex-facie this document disclosed that the partnership business had come to a halt and the Addanki family had given up their share in the machine, etc., in the business and had made it over to the Bhaskara family. It also recites that the Addanki family had already received certain properties purchased by the partnership as its share in the partnership assets. The submission was that since the partnership assets included immovable property and the document recorded relinquishment by the members of the Addanki family of their interest therein which exceeded Rupees 100 in value, the document required registration under Section 17(1) (c) of theRegistation Act. After referring to the provisions of law, treatise and the case law, both of English and Indian Courts, this Court reproduced the following passage from the decision in Ajudhia Pershad Ram Pershad v. Sham Sunder, AIR 1947 Lahore 13 with approval: \"These Sections require that the debts and liabilities should first be met out of the firm property and thereafter the assets should be applied in ratable payment to each partner of what is due to him firstly on account of advances as distinguished from capital and, secondly on account of capital, the residue, if any, being divided ratably among all the partners. It is obvious that the Act contemplates complete liquidation of the assets of the partnership as a preliminary to the settlement of accounts between partners upon dissolution of the firm and it will, therefore, be correct to say that, for the purposes of the Indian Partnership Act, and irrespective of any mutual agreement between the partners, the share of each partner is, in the words of Lindley : his proportion of the partnership assets after they have been all realised and converted into money, and all the partnership debts and liabilities have been paid and discharged.\" In Commissioner of Income-Tax, West Bengal, Calcutta v. Juggilal Kamalapat, [1967] 1 SCR 784 = AIR 1967 SC 401 the facts were that three brothers and one J. entered into a partnership business. The firm owned both moveable and immoveable properties. Sometime thereafter the three brothers created a Trust with themselves as the first three trustees and simultaneously executed a deed of relinquishment relinquishing their rights in and claims to all the properties and assets of the firm in favour of J and of themselves in the capacity of trustees. Thereafter a new partnership firm was constituted between J and the Trust with specified shares. The Trust brought a sum of Rupees 50,000 as its capital in the new firm. The new firm applied for registration under Section 26-A of the Income Tax Act, 1922 but the application was rejected by the authorities. The Tribunal held that the deed of relinquishment being unregistered could not legally transfer the rights and the title to the immoveable properties owned by the original firm to the Trust. Since the immoveable properties were not separable from the other business assets it held that there was no legal transfer of any portion of the business assets of the original firm in favour of the Trust. Areference was made to the High Court on the question whether the new partnership legally came into existence and as such should be registered under Section 26-A. The High Court held that there was no impediment to its registration. The matter was brought in appeal before this Court. This Court pointed out that the deed of relinquishment was in respect of individual interests of the three brothers in the assets of the partnership firm in favour of the Trust and consequently, did not require registration, even though the assets of the partnership included immoveable property. In taking this view reliance was placed on the decision, Ajudhia Pershad's case (supra) as well as the decision of this Court in Addanki Narayanappa & ANR (Supra). Again in CIT Madhya Pradesh v. Dawas Cine Corporation, [1968] 2 SCR 173 = AIR 1968 SC 676 the partnership firm was dissolved and on dissolution it was agreed between the partners that the theaters should be returned to their original owners who had brought them into the books of the partnership as its assets. In the books of accounts of the partnership the assets were shown as taken over on October 1. 1951 at the original price less depreciation, the depreciation being equally divided between the two partners. In the proceedings for the assessment year 1952-53 the firm was treated as a registered firm. The Appellate Tribunal held that restoration of the two theaters to the original owners amounted to transfer by the firm and the entries adjusting the depreciation and writing off the assets at the original value amounted to total recoupment of the entire depreciation by the partnership and on that account the second proviso to section 10(2)(vii) of the I.T. Act, 1922 applied. The High Court in reference upturned the decision of the Tribunal and held in favour of the assessee against which the Revenue appealed to this Court. This Court after referring to sections 46 and 48 of the Partnership Act held that on the dissolution of the partnership each theatre must be deemed to be returned to the original owner in satisfaction partially or wholly of his claim to a share in the residue of the assets after discharging the debts and other obligations. In law there was no sale or transfer by the partnership to the individual partners in consideration of their respective share in the residue. In taking this view reliance was once again placed on the decision of this court in Addanki Narayanappa & ANR (supra) In CIT. U.P. v. Bankey Lal Vaidya, AIR 1971 SC 2270 this court pointed out that on dissolution of partnership the assets of the firm arevalued and the partner is paid a certain amount in lieu of his share of the assets, the transaction is not a sale, exchange or transfer of assets of the firm and the amount received by the partner cannot be taxed as capital gains. In taking this view reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in CIT. Madhya Pradesh v. Dewas Cine Corporation , (supra). Again in Malabar Fisheries Co. Calicut v. CIT. Kerala, [1980] 1 SCR 696 = AIR 1980 SC 176 the facts were that the appellant firm which was constituted on April 1. 1959 with four partners carried on six different businesses in different names. The firm was dissolved on March 31, 1963 and under the deed of dissolution the first business concern was taken over by one of the partners, the remaining five concerns by two of the other partners and the fourth partner received his share in cash. It appears that during the assessment years 1960-61 to 1963-64 the firm had installed various items of machinery in respect of which it had received Development Rebate under Section 33 of the I.T. Act. 1961. On dissolution, the Income Tax officer took the view that section 34(3)(b) of the Act applied on the premiss that there was a sale or transfer of the machinery by the firm whereupon he withdrew the Development Rebate earlier allowed to the firm by amending the orders in that behalf. The appeal filed on behalf of the dissolved firm was dismissed by the Appallate Assistant Commissioner but was allowed by the Tribunal. At the instance of the Revenue a reference was made to the High Court and the High Court allowed the reference holding that there was a transfer of assets within the meaning of section 34(3)(b). The dissolved firm approached this court in appeal. This court after referring to the definition of the expression 'transfer' in section 2(47) of the Act and the case law on the point concluded as under : \"Having regard to the above discussion, it seems to us clear that a partnership firm under the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 is not a distinct legal entity apart from the partners constituting it and equally in law the firm as such has no separate rights of its own in the partnership assets and when one talks of the firm's property or firm's assets all that is meant is property or assets in which all partners have a joint or common interest. If that be the position, it is difficult to accept the contention that upon dissolution the firm's rights in the partnership assets are extinguished. The firm as such has no separate rights of its own in the partnership assets but it is the partners who own jointly in common the assets of the partnership and, therefore, the consequence of the distribution, division or allotment of assets to the partners which flows upon dissolution after discharge of liabilities is nothing but a mutual adjustment of rights between the partners and there is no question of any extinguishment of the firm's rights in the partnership assets amounting to a transfer of assets within the meaning of s. 2(47) of the Act.\" From the foregoing discussion it seems clear to us that regardless of its character the property brought into stock of the firm or acquired by the firm during its subsistence for the purposes and in the course of the business of the firm shall constitute the property of the firm unless the contract between the partners provides otherwise. On the dissolution of the firm each partner becomes entitled to his share in the profits, if any, after the accounts are settled in accordance with section 48 of the Partnership Act. Thus in the entire asset of the firm all the partners have an interest albeit in proportion to their share and the residue, if any, after the settlement of accounts on dissolution would have to be divided among the partners in the same proportion in which they were entitled to a share in the profit. Thus during the subsistence of the partnership a partner would be entitled to a share in the profits and after its dissolution to a share in the residue, if any, on settlement of accounts. The mode of settlement of accounts sat out in section 48 clearly indicates that the partnership asset in its entirety must be converted into money and from the pool the disbursement has to be made as set out in clause (a) and sub-clauses (i), (fi) and (iii) of clause (b) and thereafter if there is any residue that has to be divided among the partners in the proportions in which they were entitled to a share in the profits of the firm. So viewed, it becomes obvious that the residue would in the eye of law be moveable property i.e. cash, and hence distribution of the residue among the partners in proportion to their shares in the profits would not attract section 17 of the Registration Act. Viewed from another angle it must be reaslised that since a partnership is not a legal entity but is only a compendious name each and every partner has a beneficial interest in the property of the firm even though he cannot lay a claim on any earmarked portion thereof as the same cannot be predicated. Therefore, when any property is allocated to him from the residue it cannot be said that he had only a definite limited interest in thatproperty and that there is a transfer of the remaining interest in his favour within the meaning of section 17 of the Registration Act. Each and every partner of a firm has an undefined interest in each and every property of the firm and it is not possible to say unless the accounts are settled and the residue of surplus determined what would be the extent of the interest of each partner in the property. It is, however, clear that since no partner can claim a definite or earmarked interest in one or all of the properties of the firm because the interest is a fluctuating one depending on various factors, such as, the losses incurred by the firm, the advances made by the partners as distinguished from the capital brought in the firm, etc, it cannot be said, unless the accounts are settled in the manner indicated by section 48 of the partnership Act, what would be the residue which would ultimately be allocable to the partners. In that residue, which becomes divisible among the partners, every partner has an interest and when a particular property is allocated to a partner in proportion to his share in the profits of the firm, there is no partition or transfer taking place nor is there any extinguishment of interest of other partners in the allocated property in the sense of a transfer or extinguishment of interest under section 17 of the Registration Act. Therefore, viewed from this angle also it seems clear to us that when a dissolution of the partnership takes place and the residue is distributed among the partners after settlement of accounts there is no partition, transfer or extinguishment of interest attracting section 17 of the Registration Act. Strong reliance was, however, placed by the learned counsel for the respondents on two decisions of this court, namely (1) Ratan Lal Sharma v. Purshottam Harit, [1974] 3 SCR 109 and (2) Lachman Das v. Ram Lal andanr, [1989] 3 SCC 99. Insofar as the first mentioned case is concerned, the facts reveal that the appellant and the respondent who had set up a partnership business in December 1962 soon fell out. The partnership had a factory and other moveable and immoveable properties. On August 22, 1963, the partners entered into an agreement to refer the dispute to the arbitration of two persons and gave the arbitrators full authority to decide their dispute. The arbitrators made their award on September 10. 1963. Under the award exclusive allotment of the partnership assets, including the factory, and liabilities was made in favour of the appellant and it was provided that he shall be absolutely entitled to the same in considerationof a sum of Rupees 17,000 plus half the amount of realisable debts of the business to the respondent. The arbitrators filed the award in the High Court on November 8, 1963. On September 10, 1964, the respondent filed an application for determining the validity of the agreement and for setting aside the award. On May 27, 1966, a learned Single Judge of the High Court dismissed the application as barred by time but declined to make the award the rule of the court because in his view the award was void for uncertainty and created rights in favour of the appellant over immoveable property worth over Rupees 100 requiring registration. The Division Bench dismissed the appeal as not maintainable whereupon this Court was moved by special leave. Before this Court it was contended (i) that the award is not void for uncertainty-, (ii) that the award seeks to assign the respondent's share in the partnership to the appellant and therefore does not require registration; and (iii) that under section 17 of the Arbitration Act, the court was bound to pronounce judgment in accordance with the award. This court while reiterating that the share of a partner in the assets of the partnership comprising even immoveable properties, is moveable property and the assignment of the share does not require registration under section 17 of the Registration Act. The legal position is thus affirmed. However, since the award did not seek to assign the share of the respondent to the appellant but on the contrary made an exclusive allotment of the partnerShip asset including the factory and liabilities to the appellant, thereby creating an absolute interest on payment of consideration of Rupees 17,000 plus half the amount of the realisible debts, it was held to be compulsorily registrable under section 17 of the Registration Act. The Court did not depart from the principle that the share of a partner in the asset of the partnership inclusive of immoveable properties, is moveable property and the assignment of the share on dissolution of the partnership did not require registration under section 17 of the Registration Act.The decision, therefore, turned on the interpretation of the award in regard to the nature of the assignment made in favour of the appellant. So far as the second case is concerned, we think it has no bearing since that was not a case of assignment of partnership property under a dissolution deed. In that case, the dispute was between two brothers in 2-1/2 killas of land situate in Panipat, Haryana. The said land stood in the name of one brother the appellant. The respondent contended that he was a banamidar and that was the dispute which was referred to arbitration. The arbitrator made hisaward and applied to the court for making it the rule of the court. Objections were filed by the appellant raising various contentions. The award declared that half share of the ownership of the appellant shall \"be now owned by Shri Ram Lal, the respondent in addition to his half share owned in those lands\". Therefore, the award transferred half share of the appellant to the respondent and since the value thereof exceeded Rupees 100, it was held that it required registration. It is, therefore, obvious that this case has no bearing on the point in issue herein. In the present case, the Division Bench of the High Court concluded that the award required registration because of an erroneous reading of the award. The Division Bench after extensively reproducing from the Schedules A to F of the award proceeded to state in paragraph 39 that the allotments are exclusive to the brothers and they get independent rights of their own under the award in the properties allotted under the schedule and hence it is not a case purely of assignment of the shares in the partnership but it confers exclusive rights to the allottees. On this line of reasoning it concluded that the award required registration. The court next pointed out in paragraph 42 of the judgment that the award also partitions certain immoveable properties jointly owned by the disputants. In this connection it has placed reliance on paragraph 10(c) of the award which reads as under : \"(c) Other Lands and Buildings and House properties belonging to S.V. Sivalinga Nadar & Bros. standing in the name of the firm and or otherwise jointly owned by the disputants. These have been allotted by us to one or other or jointly to some of the disputants as per schedules annexed hereto.\" The reasons which weighed with the Division Bench of the High Court in concluding that the award requires registration appear to be based on an erroneous reading of the award. We have carefully read the award and it is manifest therefrom that the arbitrators had confined themselves to the properties belonging to the two firms in question and scrupulously avoided dealing with the properties not belonging to the firm. This is manifest from paragraphs 15 to 18 of the award. However, properties standing in the names of disputants, individually or jointly, and others as benamidars but belonging to the firm also came to be included in thedistribution of the surplus partnership asset under the award. That is the purport of paragraph 10(c) extracted hereinabove. When on settlement of accounts the residue is required to be divided among the partners in proportions in which they were entitled to share profits under sub-clause (iv) of clause (b) of section 48, the properties will have to be allocated to the partnes as falling to their share on the distribution of the residue and, therefore, the arbitrators indicated in the schedules the, properties falling to the share of each brother. Mere statements that a certain property win now exclusively belong to one partner or the other, as the case may be, cannot change the character of the document or the nature of assignment because that would in any case be the effect on the distribution of the residue. The property failing to the share of the partner on the distribution of the residue would naturally then belong to him exclusively but so long as in the eye of law it is money and not immoveable property there is no question of registration under section 17 of the Registration Act. Besides, as stated earlier, even if one looks at the award as allocating certain immoveable property since there is no transfer, no partition or extinguishment of any right therein there is no question of application of section 17(i) of the Registration Act. The reference to other land and buildings and house properties jointly owned by the disputants in clause (c) of paragraph 10 of the award merely indicates that certain properties belonging to the firm stood in the names of individual partners or in their joint names but they belonged to the firm and, therefore, they were taken into account for the purpose of settlement of accounts under section 48 of the partnership Act and distributed on the determination of the residue. The award read as a whole makes it absolutely clear that the arbitrators had confined themselves to the properties belonging to the two firms and had scrupulously avoided other properties in regard to which they did not reach the conclusion that they belonged to the firm. On a correct reading of the award, we are satisfied that the award seeks to distribute the residue after settlement of accounts on dissolution. While distributing the residue the arbitrators allocated the properties to the partners and showed them in the Schedules appended to the award. We are, therefore, of the opinion that on a true reading of the award as a whole, there is no doubt that it essentially deals with the distribution of the surplus properties belonging to the dissolved firms. The award, therefore, did not require registration under section 17(1) of the Registration Act. For the above reasons, we allow these appeals and set aside the impugned orders of the Division Bench and remit the matters to the Division Bench for answering the other contentions which arose in the appeal before it but which were not decided in view of its decision on the question of registration of the award. We also make it clear that the award which is pending for registration may be registered by the Sub-Registrar notwithstanding the objection raised by one of the partners S.V. Sivalings Nadar through his lawyer if that is the only reason for withholding registration. The appeals are allowed accordingly with costs. G.N.

Appeal from the Judgment and order dated the 24th April 1970 of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Miscellaneous Petition number 246 of 1967. R.P. Bhatt, Ashok Mehta, J.B. Dadachanji and D.N. Misra for the appellant. Gopal Subramanium and S. A. Shroff for the respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by B TULZAPURKAR, J. Two questions were raised for our determination in this appeal by a certificate: (a) Whether the Sugarcane Development Council, Sehore (respondent number 2) can charge commission under section 21 (1) of the Madhya Pradesh Sugar Cane (Regulation of Supply & Purchase) Act, 1958 on purchases of sugarcane made by the appellant company from outside the \"reserved area\" ? and (b) Whether the Sugar Cane-Growers Development Co- operative Union Ltd., Sehore (respondent number 3: the concerned Cane Growers Co-operative Society) can charge commission under section 21 (l) (a) of the Act in respect of the purchases of sugarcane made by the appellant through the Union when there is no quid pro quo by way of rendering any services by Union to the appellant-company ? The short facts giving rise to the above questions may be stated: The appellant-company crushes sugarcane in its factory at Sehore in Madhya Pradesh. For its business it purchases sugarcane from \"reserved area\" as well as from outside both directly from the cane-growers as well as through respondent number 3, a Cane-growers Co-operative Society, Sehore. Section 21 of the Act imposes an obligation upon the appellant-company to pay commission on all its purchases of cane at prescribed rates and it has to pay such commission in respect of purchases made through the Society to the Society and the Development Council and in respect of purchases made directly from the cane-growers to the Development Council. According to the appellant-company judicial decisions rendered by Madhya Pradesh High Court as well as this Court have settled the position that the commission chargeable under section 21 of the Act is in the nature of a fee the imposition of which is supported on the basis of quid pro quo in the shape of services rendered by the DevelopmentCouncil to a factory (vide: Jaora Sugar Mills (P) Ltd. v. State of Madhya Pradesh and others. It appears that during the seasons 1960-61 to 1964-65 the appellant-company purchased cane directly from the cultivators of \"reserved area\" as well as from the cultivators of \"non-reserved area\" and respondent number 2 (Development Council, Sehore) made a demand of commission from the appellant-company in respect of such purchases both from \"reserved area\" as well as from \"non-reserved area.\" Similarly, during the crushing seasons 1963-64 to 1966-67 the appellant-company made purchases of cane from or through respondent number 3 (Co-operative Society) in respect whereof a demand of commission was made by respondent number 3 from the appellant company. By a writ petition (being Miscellaneous Petition number 246 of 1967) filed in the Madhya Pradesh High Court at Jabalpur the appellant-company challenged the validity of the demand made by respondent number 2 insofar as it related to purchases made from non-reserved area on the ground that it (Council) was established for the reserved area of the appellant-company's factory and its functions were confined to that area and as such no commission (fee) could be recovered by it in respect of purchases made by appellant-company from non reserved area; similarly, the demand made by respondent number 3 (Co-operative Society) was challenged on the ground that no services of any kind whatsoever were rendered by it to the appellant company, and the charge would be invalid in the absence of any quid pro quo. The High Court negatived both the contentions and dismissed the petition. It is this decision of the High Court that is challenged before us in the appeal and counsel for the appellant company raised the two questions mentioned at the commencement of the judgment. Section 21, which deals with commission on. purchase of cane, runs thus: \"(1) There shall be paid by the occupier a commission for every one maund of cane purchased by the factory- (a) where the purchase is made through a Cane- growers' Co-operative Society, the commission shall be payable to the Cane-growers' Cooperative Society and the Council in such proportion as the State Government may declare; and (b) where the purchase is made directly from the cane-grower, the commission shall be payable to the Council. (2) The Commission payable under clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (1) shall be at such rates as may be prescribed provided, however, that the rate fixed under clause (b) shall not exceed the rate at which the com mission may be payable to the Council under clause (a).\" Section 30 confers power on the State Government to make rules for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of the Act and under clause (j) of sub-section (2) such Rules may provide for \"the rate at which and the manner in which commission shall be paid to the Cane-growers' Co-operative Society on the supply of cane by them.\" Under the aforesaid provisions certain rules called the Madhya Pradesh Sugar Cane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Rules, 1959 have been framed by the State Government. Rules 45 and 46 occurring in Chapter X of the Rules are material and they are as follows: \"45. The occupier of factory shall pay a commission for the cane purchased at the following rates namely:- (i) Where the purchase is made through a Cane- growers' Co-operative Society, at the rate of 5 Naya Paise per maund out of which 2 Naya Paise shall be payable to the Society and 3 Naya Paise to the Council; (ii) Where the purchase is made directly from the cane-growers, at the rate of 3 Naya Paise per maund, payable to the Council. 46. In determining the proportion to which payments out of commission shall be made to the Council and the Cane-growers' Co-operative Society of an are the State Government may take into consideration the financial resources and the working requirements of the Council and the Cane-growers' Co-operative Society.\" It is thus clear from the aforesaid statutory provisions that every factory is under an obligation to pay commission on all its purchases of cane at the prescribed rates and it has to pay such commission at the rate of 2 Naya Paise per maund to the Society and 3 Naya Paise to the Council in respect of purchases made through a Cane-growers' Co-operative Society and at the rate of 3 Naya Paise per maund to the Council where the purchases are made directly from the cultivators or cane-growers. It cannot be and was not disputed by Counsel on behalf of the respondents that the levy under section 21 of the Act though called \"commission\" is really in the nature of a fee, the imposition of which is supportable only on the basis of quid pro quo in the shape of rendition of services to the factory in the matter of cane purchased by it and Counsel accepted this position as emerging from this Court's decision in Jaora Sugar Mills' case (supra). Now, turning to the first question raised before us Counsel for the appellant-company contended that respondent number 2 Council has been established for the \"reserved area\" of the appellant's factory so declared under section 15 of the Act, that respondent number 2 Council is required to discharge its statutory functions and duties under section 6 of the Act confined to the \"reserved area\" meant for the appellant's factory and as such the demand for commission (fee) in respect of purchases of cane made by the appellant-factory from non-reserved areas (which it is entitled to make along with its purchases from the \"reserved area\") would be illegal and without any authority of law because in respect of such purchases there is no quid pro quo in the shape of rendering of services by respondent number 2 to the appellant- factory. It is not possible to accept this contention for more than one reason. In the first place there are no qualifying words to be found in section 21 of the Act which limit the imposition of commission (fee) to purchases of cane made by a factory from reserved area only; the imposition is on every maund of cane purchased by factory irrespective of the area from where such purchases may have been made. Secondly, and this is important, if the relevant provisions of ss. 5 and 6 of the Act are carefully examined it will appear that the functions and duties of the Development Council are not confined to the \"reserved area\" of a factory asurged by the Counsel for the appellant-company. Under section 5 \"there shall be established, by notification, for the reserved area of a factory a Cane Development Council which shall be a body cooperate provided that where the Cane Commissioner so directs, the Council may be established for a larger or smaller area \"than the reserved area of a factory\" and sub-section (2) provides that \"the area for which a council is established shall be called a Zone\". In other words, the Zone area of operation) of a Council could be larger than the \"reserved area\" of a factory i.e. would, include area outside the reserved area of the factory. Further, the functions and duties of the Council are indicated seriatim in cls. (a) to (g) of sub-section (1) of section 6 and these include functions like considering and approving development programmes for the Zone, devising ways and means for execution of development plan in all its essentials such as cane varieties, cane-seed, sowing programme, fertilizers and manures, taking steps for the prevention of diseases and pests and rendering all help in soil extension work, etc. etc. and it will be noticed that some of these functions under clause (b), (d) and (e) are of general character and not confined even to the Zone of the Council. In other words, the functions and duties of the Council which are in the nature of rendering services in the matter of better cane production, distribution and supply thereof to the factory are not confined to the \"reserved area\" so declared for a factory under sec. 15 of the Act. If that be so it is difficult to accept the contention that in the matter of cane purchases made by the appellant's factory from non- reserved areas no services are rendered by the respondent number 2 Council to the appellant's factory. The quid pro quo being there the imposition of a fee on such purchases from non-reserved areas would be proper and justified. As regards the demand and recovery of commission (fee) by respondent number 3 under section 21(1)(a) in respect of purchases of sugarcane made by the appellant's factory through it, the contention of Counsel for the appellant- company has been that respondent number 3 is the concerned Cane-growers' Co-operative Society in the area, one of the objects of which is to sell cane grown by its members to the appellant's factory, that the said Society does not render any services to the appellant's factory under the Act or otherwise and hence is not entitled to recover any fee from the appellant-company. It is pointed out that respondent number 3 is meant for helping its members and in fact renders various types of services to its cultivator-membersso that they are not exploited. In fact in the matter of supplies of cane made through the respondent number 3 it is the Society which deals with its members who receive their price from the Society. Counsel pointed out that even in the return filed by respondent number 3 to the writ petition, respondent number 3 enumerated four types of services which it claimed was rendering to the appellant's factory, namely, (a) it made arrangements for lump-sum cane supply on lump- sum demand from the factory; apart from convenience this resulted in economy to the factory as it had to maintain less staff; (b) it undertook equitable distribution of quota and the factory had not to undertake this function; (c) it undertook the maintenance of the records of individual growers for cane supplies and the factory had not to undertake this function and (d) it made payment to the suppliers though the factory is required to make payments for supplies effected immediately and in actual practice mostly the factory made payments late at its convenience but the Society made payments to the suppliers regularly according to the programme drawn by it; the appellant's factory thus benefited by the existence of this Society. But according to Counsel for the appellant company none of these items referred to above really amounts to rendering any service to the appellant's factory by way of conferring on it some special benefit having a direct, close or reasonable correlation to its transactions of purchase of cane and, if at all, all these items referred to in the Return are really for the benefit of cultivator-members of the Society and in this behalf, Counsel relied upon a decision of this Court in Kewal Krishan Puri's case where in the context of enhanced market fee levied under Punjab Agricultural Produce Market Act, 1961 this Court has observed that the quid pro quo by way of rendering services must result in the conferral of some special benefits to the persons charged which have a direct, close and reasonable correlation between such persons and their transactions and that any indirect or remote benefit to them would in no sense be such benefit. Counsel for the appellant-company, therefore, urged that since in everything that is being done by it respondent number 3 is rendering services to its own members and no services resulting in any special benefit to the appellant's factory are rendered, no charge by way of any fee would be legally recoverable by respondent number 3 from the appellant's factory. In our view having regard to the scheme of the Act and the activities which respondent number 3 has been undertaking in the discharge of its normal functions it will be difficult to accept the contention urged by Counsel for the appellant's factory that no services of any kind whatsoever resulting in conferral of special benefits on the appellant's factory in regard to its transactions of purchases of cane are rendered by respondent number 3 to the appellant's factory. The scheme of the Act is that under sections 15 and 16 a declaration of reserved and assigned areas for purchase and supply of sugarcane is made by the Cane Commissioner for every factory after consulting in the manner prescribed the occupier of the factory and the Cane- growers' Co-operative Society, if any, in that area and upon declaration of such areas an obligation is cast upon the occupier of the factory, in the case of \"reserved area\", to purchase all cane grown in such area which is offered for sale and in respect of \"assigned area\" to purchase such quantity of cane grown therein and offered for sale for the factory as may be determined by the Cane Commissioner. Further, under section 19 the State Government can by order regulate the distribution, sale and purchase of cane within any \"reserved and assigned area\" as also from areas other than \"reserved and assigned areas\" and under clause (b) of sub- sec. (2) such order made by the State Government may provide for the manner in which cane grown in the \"reserved area\" or the \"assigned area\" shall be purchased by the factory and the cane grown by a cane-grower shall not be purchased except through a Cane-growers' Co-operative Society. In other words the scheme of Act contemplates situations where the appellant's factory may have to purchase cane from within reserved or assigned areas only through the respondent number 3 Society. Moreover in its Return the respondent number 3 has averred that under its bye-laws the Society is established to develop scientific methods of sugar cane growing and calls on its members to introduce modern means of implements for cultivating sugarcane which unquestionably makes for assured bulk supply of uniformly good quality cane through its members to the appellant's factory. In other words this function undertaken by respondent number 3 is of a nature or kind similar to that undertaken by the council and therefore it cannot be said that no services conferring special benefit on the appellant's factory in the matter of its purchases of cane are rendered by respondent No; 3 to the appellant's factory. Having regard to the aforesaid position it is not possible to accept the contention that in respect of purchases of cane made through the respondent number 3 Society there is no element of quid pro quo in the shape of rendering services by respondent number 3 to the appellant's factory. In the result both the questions are answered against the appellant-company and the appeal is dismissed with costs. H.L.C.

Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated January 28, 1954, of the Patna High Court in Criminal Revision number 69 of 1954 arising out of the judgment and order dated November 23, 1953, of the Sessions Judge, Patna, in Criminal Appeal number 288 of 1953 against the judgment and order dated August 27, 1953, of the Munsif Magistrate of Patna Sadar. Murtaza Fazl Ali and R. C. Prasad, for the appellant. S. P. Varma, for respondent number 1. 1957. April 25. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by IMAM J.-The appellant was removed from his position as mutawalli of Gholam Yahia Waqf Estate on September 1, 1951, by an order passed by the Majlis constituted under the Bihar Waqfs Act, 1947 (Bihar Act 8 of 1948) (hereinafter referred to as the Act). He appealed to the District Judge of Monghyr, as he was entitled to do under the provisions of the Act, and the operation of the order of removal passed by the Majlis was stayed by the District Judge pending the hearing of his appeal. A complaint against him was filed in the Court of the Sadar Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Patna, on July 1, 1952, by Mahommad Sual, Nazir of the Majlis, on the order of its Sadar. It was alleged in the complaint that it was the duty of the appellant' to prepare a budget of the waqf estate of which he was a mutawalli, under section 58(1) of the Act, for the year1034 1952-53 and to send a copy of it to the Majlis before January 15, 1952. The appellant had deliberately failed to comply with the aforesaid provisions and therefore had committed an offence punishable under section 65(1) of the Act. The office of the Majlis where the budget had to be filed was situated at Patna within the local jurisdiction of the Magistrate in whose Court the complaint was filed. The appellant was subsequently tried at Patna by a Munsif Magistrate with First Class powers and convicted under s. 65(1) of the Act and sentenced to pay a fine of Rupees 100, in default to undergo fifteen days simple imprisonment. He appealed to the Sessions Judge of Patna who dismissed his appeal. An application filed by the appellant in the Patna High Court in its criminal revisional jurisdiction was rejected. The appellant obtained special leave to appeal against the order of the High Court. It has been found as a fact that the appellant failed to prepare a budget of the estimated income and expenditure of the waqf estate and to send a copy of it to the Majlis before January 15, 1952. The only question for consideration is whether the appellant's failure to comply with the provisions of section 58(1) of the Act makes him liable to be punished under section 65(1). At this stage, it is necessary to set out the provisions of a. 58 of the Act which are as follows: \" 58 (1) The mutawalli of every waqf shall, before the fifteenth day of January in each year, prepare a budget of the estimated income and expenditure of such waqf for the next succeeding financial year and shall forthwith send a copy thereof to the Majlis. (2)The Majlis may, within six weeks from the date on which it receives such copy, alter or modify the budget in such manner and to such extent as it thinks fit. (3)If the Majlis alters or modifies any budget under sub- section (2), it, shall forthwith send a copy of the budget as so altered or modified to the mutawalli of the waqf concerned, and the budget as so altered or modified shall be deemed to be the budget of the waqf. (4)If within the period mentioned in subsection (2) and for two weeks thereafter the Majlis doesnot send to the mutawalli of the waqf concerned a copy of the budget altered or modified as aforesaid, the Majlis shall be deemed to have approved the budget without any alteration or modification. (5)If the mutawalli fails to prepare and send a copy of the budget as required by sub-section (1), the Majlis shall prepare a budget for the waqf concerned and such budget shall be deemed to be the budget of that waqf for the year in question. (6)Nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to authorise the Majlis to alter or modify any budget in a manner or to an extent inconsistent with the wishes of the waqif, so far as such wishes can be ascertained, or the provisions of this Act.\" Section 65 provides that a mutawalli may be punished if he fails to comply with certain matters mentioned therein including his failure to comply with sub-section (1) of section 58. Sub-section (1) of section 65 reads as follows: \" 65 (1) If a mutawalli fails without reasonable cause, the burden of proving which shall be upon him, to comply with any order or direction made or issued under clauses (i), (o) or (q) of sub-section (2) of section 27 or under section 56, to comply with the provisions of sub-section (1) of section 57, sub-section (1) of section 58, section 59 or section 60, or to furnish any statement, annual account, estimate, explanation or other document or information relating to the waqf of which he is mutawalli, which he is required or called upon to furnish under any of the other provisions of this Act, he shall be punishable with fine which may extend, in the case of the first offence, to two hundred rupees and, in the case of second or any subsequent offence, to five hundred rupees. \" It is clear from the provisions of section 58(1) that before January 15, each year, the mutawalli of each waqf shall prepare a budget for the next succeeding financial year and shall forthwith send a copy thereof to the Majlis. Under s. 65 (1), if he fails to comply with the above, he is liable to be punished with fine. It was contended by the learned Advocate for the appellant that section 58 of the Act was an invalid provision because it gave unrestricted power to the Majlis to alteror modify the budget prepared by the mutawalli without a right of appeal against the action of the Majlis altering or modifying the budget. The provisions of section 58 imposed an unreasonable restriction on the mutawalli in carrying on his occupation as such. Accordingly, the provisions of section 58 offended article 19(1) (g) of the Constitution.. The Act was enacted for the purpose of providing for the better administration of waqfs in the State of Bihar as its preamble states. Section 5 provides for the establishment of two bodies corporate known as Majlis to discharge respectively the functions assigned to them by the Act with reference to Sunni waqfs and Shia waqfs. Section 27 provides that the general superintendence of all waqfs in the State shall be vested in the Majlis, which will do all things reasonable and necessary to ensure that waqfs are properly supervised and administered and that the income thereof is duly appropriated and applied to the objects of such waqfs and in accordance with the purposes for which such waqfs were founded or for which they exist so far as such objects and purposes can be ascertained. Sub-section (2) of this section enumerates, inter alia,. the various powers and duties of the Majlis including the removal of a mutawalli from his office under certain conditions. The various powers set out in this subsection clearly indicate that the mutawalli is subordinate to and under the control of the Majlis. The Majlis under section 47 may also make an application to the District Judge for an order, amongst other things, for the removal of the mutawalli. Chapter X deals with mutawallis and their duties and under section 56 it is specifically enjoined that every mutawalli shall carry out all directions which may from time to time be issued to him by the Majlis under any of the provisions of the Act. Previous to the passing of the Act, the Mussalman Wakf Act (Central Act XLII of 1923) was enacted to make provisions for the better management of waqf property and for ensuring the keeping and publication of proper accounts in respect of such properties. It applied to all waqfs, except those to which section 3 of the Mussalman Wakf Validating Act,1913, applied. Reference to some of the provisions of the Mussalman Wakf Act may now be made. Section 3 provides for the furnishing of particulars relating to a waqf to the Court, that is to say, a District Judge or within the limits of ordinary original civil jurisdiction, to such Court subordinate to the High Court as the State Government may by notification in the Official Gazette designate. Section 5 provides that within three months after the thirty-first day of March next following the date on which the statement referred to in section 3 had been furnished, and thereafter within three months of the thirty-first day of March in every year, the mutawalli shall prepare and furnish to the Court a full and true statement of accounts of all moneys received or expended by him on behalf of the waqf of which he was the mutawalli during the period of twelve months ending on such thirty-first day of March. Section 10 provides for punishment for failure to comply with the provisions of section 3 or section 4 by a mutawalli, who becomes liable to be fined a sum which may extend to five hundred rupees, or, in the case of a second or subsequent offence which may extend to two thousand rupees. It is clear that the purpose of the Act and that of the Mussalman Wakf Act was to ensure that the waqfs were properly administered and that the income of the waqf was duly appropriated for the purposes for which the waqf had been founded. Having regard to the fact that the mutawalli occupied the position of a manager or a custodian and that some kind of control or supervision over him by the Majlis with respect to due administration of the waqf property and due appropriation of funds was certainly necessary, we are of the opinion that the provisions of section 58 of the Act are reasonable restrictions on the exercise of his duties as a mutawalli and it cannot be said that the provisions of section 58 offend any of the provisions of the Constitution. As was said in the case of The Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt(1) a budget is indispensable in all public institutions and that it is not per se (1) [1954] S.C.R. 1005, 1037.unreasonable to provide for the budget of a religious institution being prepared under the supervision of the Commissioner or the Area Committee. Under section 58 of the Act, the mutawalli has to prepare a budget and send a copy of it to the Majlis within a specified time and the Majlis, which has the powers of supervision over him, is authorized to alter or modify the budget. This power of alteration or modification is inherent in the power of supervision and such a provision in section 58 cannot be said to be unreasonable. Reliance, however, was placed on a passage in the judgment of this Court in the case cited above to the effect that if an Area Committee under clause 3 of section 70 of the Madras Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1951, makes any addition or alteration in the budget, an appeal against it lay to the Deputy Commissioner. The passage upon which reliance is placed is no authority for the proposition that the provisions of section 58 of the Act become unreasonable because there is no provision for an appeal against the orders of the Majlis. The powers of the Majlis to alter or modify the budget prepared by the mutawalli are not unrestricted. Sub-section (6) of section 58 expressly provides that nothing contained in the section shall be deemed to authorize the Majlis to alter or modify any budget in a manner or to an extent inconsistent with the wishes of the waqif, so far as such wishes can be ascertained, or the provisions of the Act. In our opinion, nothing contained in sub-ss. (2), (3) and (4) of section 58 amount to unreasonable restrictions on the exercise of the duties of the mutawalli as a person administering a waqf. Even if it were to be assumed that the said provisions amounted to an unreasonable restriction, sub-ss. (2), (3) and (4) are clearly severable from sub-ss. (1), (5) and (6) of section 58. Even if sub-ss. (2), (3) and 4 were struck down, the mutawalli would still be under a legal obligation under sub-section (1) to prepare a budget and submit a copy thereof to the Majlis within a specified time and his failure to do so would make him liable to punishment under section 65(1). It was urged that the Sessions Judge erred in placing the onus on the appellant under section 65(1) to prove that he had submitted the copy of the budget within time.This objection, however, does not require a detailed consideration because the Sessions Judge clearly stated in his judgment that apart from the onus, he was satisfied that the prosecution had fully established on the evidence that the appellant had failed to send a copy of the budget as required by law. It was also pointed out that section 65 does not provide for any imprisonment in default of payment of fine, but the appellant was sentenced to 15 days simple imprisonment in default of payment of fine. Section 33 of the Code of Criminal Procedure read with ss. 40 and 67 of the Indian Penal Code appears to us to be a clear answer to this contention. It was also pointed out that under section 65 of the Act a sentence of fine extending upto five hundred rupees could be imposed for a second or for a subsequent offence. We need not, however, consider that matter in the present appeal as it was conceded on behalf of the appellant that the sentence of fine imposed upon him in the present case was for a first offence. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. Appeal dismissed."}, "annotations": [{"result": [{"value": {"start": 0, "end": 67, "text": "CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal number 39 of 1955.", "labels": ["NONE"]}}, {"value": {"start": 68, "end": 432, "text": "Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated January 28, 1954, of the Patna High Court in Criminal Revision number 69 of 1954 arising out of the judgment and order dated November 23, 1953, of the Sessions Judge, Patna, in Criminal Appeal number 288 of 1953 against the judgment and order dated August 27, 1953, of the Munsif Magistrate of Patna Sadar.", "labels": ["NONE"]}}, {"value": {"start": 433, "end": 530, "text": "Murtaza Fazl Ali and R.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Ray, C.J.-Two of these appeals are by special leave and one by certificate from the judgment dated 17 December, 1971 of the Full Bench of the High Court at Allahabad. Civil Appeal number 1940 of 1972 arises out of the Writ Petition number 3294 of 1970. Writ Petition number 3294 of 1970 was filed before the Lucnow Bench of the High Court by respondents numbers 3 to 9 for quashing the order dated 12 May, 1970 passed by the State Transport Appellate Tribunal at Lucknow. The respondents also claimed the direction that the judgment of the High Court sitting at Lucknow dated 15 September, 1966 in Writ Petition number 750 of 1964 is a nullity. The facts in Writ Petition number 3294 of 1970 are these. The Regional Transport Authority, Bareilly fixed the strength of Chandausi-Rajghat route at 5 stage carriage permits. The appellant and the respondent number 3 applied for grant of permits. The Regional Transport Authority, Bareilly, by order dated 2 October, 1961 instead of granting five permits, increased the strength of the route to 15 permits and granted one permit each to the appellant, the respondent number 3 and 13 others. The permit granted to the appellant was valid from 9 June, 1961 to 8 June 1964. The unsuccessful appellants filed appeals against the order. By an order dated 28 March, 1963, the State Transport Appellate Tribunal at Lucknow allowed all the nine appeals and remanded the matter to the Regional Transport Authority, Bareilly, for reconsideration. The Regional Transport Authority, Bareilly, by an order dated 28 April, 1964 granted five permits, one of which was granted to the respondent number 1. The appellant was not granted a permit. The Regional Transport Authority, Bareilly had, in the meanwhile, 20 February, 1963, increased the strength of the routes from 5 to 15 and invited applications. Respondents number 4, 5 and 7 applied for the grant of permits. The appellant filed Writ Petition number 750 of 1964 before the Judges of the High Court sitting at Lucknow, challenging the order of the Appellate Tribunal, Lucknow, dated 28th March, 1963 as well as the order of the Regional Transport Authority, Bareilly dated 28 April, 1964. On 9 June 1966 the appellant succeeded in his Writ Petition number 750 of 1964. The order of the Appellate Tribunal, Lucknow, dated 28 March, 1963 and the Regional Transport Authority, Bareilly, dated 28 April, 1964 were quashed and the Appellate Tribunal was directed to re-hear the appeals on merits. On 1 November, 1965, the Regional Transport Authority, Bareilly, rejected the application of the appellant for the renewal of his permit on the ground that the permit granted to him originally was set aside by the Appellate Tribunal by an order dated 28 March, 1963. The appellant preferred an appeal to the Appellate Tribunal and succeeded on 8 January, 1968. On 17 June, 1968, the Appellate Tribunal, in pursuance of the orders of the High Court in Writ Petition number 750 of 1964, issued notice to the 15 persons who had been granted permits originally and the 9 persons, who had preferred appeals, regarding rehearing of the appeals. Against the said order, the respondent number 3filed Writ Petition number 4213 of 1968 in the High Court at Allahabad. The writ petition was admitted and a stay order was granted. However, on 25 April, 1968, the stay order was vacated. The Appellate Tribunal at Lucknow, pursuant to the orders in Writ Petition number 750 of 1964, heard the appeals and directed the Regional Transport Authority, Bareilly to grant one permanent stage carriage permit to each of the respondents numbers 10 to 12. Inasmuch as the appellant was granted a permit in pursuance of the order in Writ Petition number 750 of 1964, the Appellate Tribunal did not think it necessary to pass any order in his case. Respondent number 1 and respondent number 3 filed writ petition number 3294 of 1970 in the High Court at Allahabad. One of the grounds in the writ petition was that the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court had no jurisdiction to entertain and decide the writ petition number 750 of 1964, because the dispute arose at Bareilly in Rohilkhand Division, which was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Allahabad High Court, sitting at Allahabad, and it had nothing to do with the Oudh territory. The matter was referred to the Full Bench. In Civil Appeal number 1941 of 1972 the appellants filed writ petition number 470 of 1971 in the High Court at Lucknow for a writ of certiorari for quashing order dated 11 December, 1970 passed by the Deputy Director of Consolidation, Shahjahanpur, with headquarters at Lucknow. The appellants filed objections under section 9 of the Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1954. Their objections were allowed by the Consolidation officer. On appeal the order was upheld by the Settlement Officer, Consolidation, Shahjahanpur. The respondent number 1 to went up in revision and the Deputy Director, Consolidation, on 11 December, 1970, set aside the order. It is this order which forms subject-matter of writ petition number 4170 of 1971. On 26 July, 1971 the writ petition was listed for orders before a Division Bench consisting of the Chief Justice of the High Court and another learned Judge sitting at Lucknow. The Registry of the High Court at Lucknow reported that the petition related to the District of Shahjahanpur and question was raised as to the competency of the writ petition being presented before the Bench sitting at Lucknow. The matter eventually came before the Full Bench. Criminal Appeal number 254 of 1974 arises out of the Criminal Revision number 270 of 1973 filed in the High Court at Allahabad. The revision relates to the sentence under section 25 of the Arms Act passed by the Temporary Civil & Sessions Judge, Rae Bareli. Question arose as to whether the revision should have been filed before the Lucknow Bench. Eventually the matter came before the Full Bench. It is in this context that the following five questions were referred for decision to the Full Bench : \"(1) Can a case falling within the jurisdiction of the Lucknow Bench of this Court be presented at Allahabad ? (2) Can the Judges sitting at Allahabad summarily dismiss a case presented at Allahabad pertaining to the jurisdiction of the Lucknow Bench ? (3) Can a case pertaining to the jurisdiction of Lucknow Bench, presented and entertained at Allahabad, be decided finally by the Judges sitting at Allahabad, without there being an order as contemplated by the second proviso to Article 14 of the U.P. High Court (Amalgamation) order, 1948 ? \"(4) What is the meaning of the expression \"in respect of cases arising in such areas in oudh\" used in first proviso to Article 14 of the High Court (Amalgamation) order, 1948 ? Has this expression reference to the place where the case originated or to the place of the sitting of the last Court of authority whose decree or order is being challenged in the proceedings before the High Court ? (5) Whether this writ petition can be entertained, heard and decided by the Judges sitting at Lucknow ? The majority view of the Full Bench gave the following answers:- \"(1) A case falling within the jurisdiction of Judges at Lucknow should be presented at Lucknow and not at Allahabad. (2) However, if such a case is presented at Allahabad, the Judges at Allahabad cannot summarily dismiss it only for that reason. The case should be returned for filing before the Judges at Lucknow and where the case has been mistakenly or inadvertently entertained at Allahabad, a direction should be made to the High Court office to transmit the papers of the case to Lucknow. (3) A case pertaining to the jurisdiction of the Judges at Lucknow and presented before the Judges at Allahbad cannot be decided by the Judges at Allahabad in the absence of an order contemplated by the second proviso to Article 14 of the Amalgamation order, 1948. (4) The expression \"in respect of cases arising in such areas in oudh\" used in the first proviso to Article 14 of the High Court (Amalgamation) order, 1948, refers to legal proceedings, including civil cases, criminal cases, petitions under Articles 226, 227 and 228 of the Constitution and petitions under Articles 132 133 and 134 of the Constitution instituted before the Judges sitting at Lucknow and having their origin, in the sense explained in the majority judgment in such areas in oudh as the Chief Justice may direct. The expression \"arising in such areas in oudh\" refers to the place where the case originated in the sense explained in the majority judgment and not to the place sitting of the last court or authority whose decree or order is being challenged in the proceeding before the High Court. (5) The Lucknow Bench have no jurisdiction to hear writ petition number 750 of 1964 which gave rise to writ petition number 3294 of 1970.\" The United Provinces High Courts (Amalgamation) order, 1948, hereinafter referred to as the order, was promulgated under section 229 of the Government of India Act, 1935. The order came into effect on the appointed day, namely, 26 July, 1948. \"Existing High Court\" in the order means the High Court referred to in Section 219 of the Government of India Act as the High Court in Allahabad and the Chief Court in Oudh. As from the appointed day, the High Court at Allahabad and the Chief Court in Oudh shall constitute one High Court by the name of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad referred to as \"the new High Court\" (Paragraph 3). The two crucial provisions are Paragraphs 7 and 14 in the order. The High Court referred to the provisions of the order as Articles but we have referred to the same as Paragraphs. Paragraph 7 is as follows : \"7. (1) The new High Court shall have, in respect of the whole of the United Provinces, all such original, appellate and other jurisdiction as, under the law in force immediately before the appointed day, is exercisable in respect of any part of that Province by either of the existing High Courts. (2) The new High Court shall also have in respect of any areas outside the United Provinces all such original, appellate and other jurisdiction as under the law in force immediately before the appointed day is exercisable in respect of that area by the High Court in Allahabad.\" Paragraph 14 is as follows: \"14. The new High Court, and the judges and division courts thereof, shall sit at Allahabad or at such other places in the United Provinces as the Chief Justice may, with the approval of the Governor of the United Provinces, appoint : Provided that unless the Governor of the United Provinces with the concurrence of the Chief Justice, otherwise directs, such judges of the new High Court not less than two in number, as the Chief Justice, may, from time to time nominate, shall sit at Lucknow in order to exercise in respect of cases arising in such areas in oudh, as the Chief Justice may direct, the jurisdiction and power for the time being vested in the new High Court : Provided further that the Chief Justice may in his discretion order that any case or class of cases arising in the said areas shall be heard at Allahabad.\" The High Court considered paragraphs 7 and 14 of the Orders to mean that the new High Court has its seat at Allahabad which is the permanent seat. The reasons given by the High Court are three. First, paragraph 3 of the order which states that there will be one High Court by the name of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad indicates that the permanent seat is at Allahabad. Second, the second proviso to paragraph 14 of the order which confers power on the Justice in his discretion to order that any case or class of cases arising in Oudh areas shall be heard at Allahabad, shows that there is one identifiable permanent seat and that is the principal seat of the High Court at Allahabad. Third, the words \"the new High Court and the Judges and division courts thereof, shall sit at Allahabad or at such other places in the United Provinces as the Chief Justice may, with the approval of the Governor of the United Provinces, appoint\" occurring in the main provision of paragraph 14 of the order mean that the word \"or\" occurring between the words \"Allahabad\" and \"at such other places\" is to be read as \"and\". The second matter decided by the High Court is that the Judges at Lucknow Bench will hear cases arising in specified Oudh areas as the Chief Justice directs. The High Court held as follows. It is open to the Chief Justice to reduce the areas in Oudh referred to in the list proviso to paragraph 14 of the order and further that the Bench, at Lucknow Bench will hear cases arising in specified Oudh areas as the currence of the Chief Justice. The first proviso to paragraph 11 of the order which speaks of such areas in oudh followed by the words as the Chief Justice may direct\", shows that areas in Oudh will be such as will be specified by the Chief Justice. Under the first proviso to paragraph 14 of the order all cases arising in areas in Oudh as directed be the Chief Justice will be heard at Lucknow. The High Court further held as follows. The first proviso to Paragraph 14 of the order consists of two parts. The first part requires that as least two Judges will sit at Lucknow. The insistence on Lucknow as a place of sitting under the first proviso overrides the discretion of the Chief Justice to appoint any other place with the approval of the Governor because until the Governor otherwise directs with the concurrence of the Chief Justice, Lucknow will remain a place of sitting. The second part of the first proviso to paragraph 14 of the Order, namely that Judges sitting at Lucknow shall exercise jurisdiction in respect of cases arising in such oudh areas, specifies the work which the Judges at Lucknow will do, which can be described as amounting in substance to a statutory allocation of the category ofcases mentioned there to the Judges at Lucknow. Such allocation necessarily implies that other Judges will not do that class of work, unless it is also expressly allocated to them. The third matter decided by the High Court is the interpretation of the second proviso to paragraph 14 of the order, which confers power on the Chief Justice in his discretion to order that any case or class cases arising in the said areas shall be heard at Allahabad. The High Court expressed these views. This proviso shows that Judges a Lucknow Bench are alone competent to hear cases arising in the specified oudh areas and that the order of the Chief Justice under the second proviso alone enables such cases being heard at Allahabad. The second proviso to paragraph 14 of the order is held by the High Court to mean that the Chief Justice has power not only to make a order in respect of cases which have been filed at and are pending a Lucknow but also cases which have not yet been filed or which may be filed in future at Lucknow. The meaning of the would \"heard\" in the second proviso to paragraph 14 of the order is not confined to the actual hearing of cases but will include the proceeding stages of the institution of a case and of its, being entertained by the High Court. If cases arising in Oudh areas can be transferred by the Chief Justice for being heard at Allahabad, it obviously means that cases arising in Oudh areas are cases which are instituted because they arise in Oudh areas. The second proviso means that cases covered by the direction of the Chief Justice cannot be instituted at Lucknow but only at Allahabad for being heard there. The second proviso to paragraph 14 of the order qualifies the second part of the first proviso. The second proviso deals with cases arising in the specified Oudh areas, and provides an exception to the rule stated in the second part of the first proviso. The effect of reading the two provisos together is that the Judges at Lucknow are alone competent to hear cases arising in the specified oudh areas except where the Chief Justice orders that any such case or class of cases shall be heard at Allahabad. On this reasoning the High Court has that paragraph 14 of the order first provides for the place of sitting of the Judges and second specifies the category of cases which will be heard by them. The High Court also said as follows. The jurisdiction defined by paragraph 7 of the order vests in the entire body of Judges. It is the jurisdiction enjoyed by every Judge of the High Court and extends to all cases throughout the territories of that State. Where that jurisdiction will be exercised is a matter to be determined under paragraph 14 of the order. It may be exercised at Allahabad or it may be exercised at Lucknow or at any other place appointed by the Chief Justice under paragraph 14. The Judges at Lucknow hear cases arising in such areas in Oudh as the Chief Justice directs. It is open to the Chief Justice to reduce the areas from time to time. Cases arising in the areas so removed can no longer be heard at Lucknow. They will be heard at Allahabad or at any other place appointed under the main pro-vision of paragraph 14. A stage may be reached in the process of reduction where only one area of Oudh alone may remain with the Judges sitting at Lucknow. There is also power in the Chief Justice, by virtue of second proviso, to increase by order that classes of cases arising in Oudh areas shall be heard at Allahabad. Finally, the arrangement that some Judges must sit at Lucknow may be abolished by the Governor with the concurrence of the Chief Justice. The fourth question on which the High Court expressed its opinion is on the meaning of \"cases arising in such areas in Oudh\". The High Court expressed the following views. A distinction arises between civil and criminal cases on the one hand and writ petitions under Article 226 on the other. The contention based on Article 225 that Lucknow Bench will not have jurisdiction under Article 226 is wrong because the jurisdiction of the High Court is not only the jurisdiction exercisable before the Constitution came into force but also the jurisdiction which could be conferred on the High Court in future. The Lucknow Bench, therefore, exercises jurisdiction under Article 226. Though the Lucknow Bench can exercise jurisdiction under Articles 226, 227 and 228, there is limitation on such jurisdiction as far as the Lucknow Bench is concerned. The Lucknow Bench will have jurisdiction under Article 226 only in cases where the right of the petitioner arose first within the oudh areas. Where an original order passed outside the oudh areas has been reversed or modified or confirmed at a place within the Oudh areas it is not the place where the ultimate or the appellate order is passed that will attract jurisdiction of the Lucknow Bench. In most cases where an appeal or revision will lie to the State Government, the order will be made at Lucknow. In all such cases, if it be held that the place where a case can be said to arise is where the ultimate or appellate order is passed by the authority, the Judges at Lucknow would then have jurisdiction even though the controversy originally arose and the original order was made by an authority outside the specified Oudh areas. In all cases a writ petition filed in the High Court would be a case arising at Lucknow. It is on this reasoning that the High Court strictly confined the jurisdiction of the Lucknow Bench under Article 226 to the right which the petitioner pursues throughout the original proceedings, the appellate proceedings and thereafter in the High Court.The right of the petitioner is the right which first arose and if the place where the right first arose will be within the Oudh areas then the Lucknow Bench will have jurisdiction. With regard to the civil and criminal cases, the High Court said that the Lucknow Bench would have jurisdiction in a civil case where the cause of action wholly or in part arose. In a criminal case the Lucknow Bench would have jurisdiction where the offence has been committed. The conclusion as well as the reasoning of the High Court that the permanent seat of the High Court is at Allahabad is not quite sound the order states that the High Court shall sit as the new High Court and the Judges and Division Bench thereof shall sit at Allahabad or atsuch other places in the United Provinces as the Chief Justice may, with the approval of the Governor of the United Provinces, appoint. The word \"or\" cannot be read as \"and\". If the precise words used are plain and unambiguous, they are bound to be construed in their ordinary sense. The mere fact that the results of a statute may be unjust does not entitle a court to refuse to give it effect. If there are two different interpretations of the words in an Act, the Court will adopt that which is just, reasonable and sensible rather than that which is none of those things. If the inconvenience is an absurd inconvenience, by reading an enactment in its ordinary sense, whereas if it is read in a manner in which it is capable, though not in an ordinary sense, there would not be any inconvenience at all; there would be reason why one should not read it according to its ordinary grammatical meaning. Where the words are plain the Court would not make any alteration. The arguments which were presented at the Bar on behalf of the Bar Association at Allahabad as well as the Bar Association at Lucknow suggested that those views can be described to be protagonists of Allahabad or of Lucknow on the one hand and antagonists to Allahabad or Lucknow on the other. The construction is to be dispassionate without any leaning either in favour or against either of the places mentioned in the Order. The order describes the High Court as the new High Court. The two High Courts have amalgamated in the new High Court. The seat is at Allahabad or at such other places as may be determined. There is no permanence attached to Allahabad. If that were the intention of the Order, the word \"and\" instead of the word \"or\" would have been used. Other places may be determined by the Chief Justice in consultation with the Governor. It is left to prudence of the authorities mentioned as to what other places should be determined. In the normal understanding of the matters, it is left to the discretion of the authorities as to whether the seats at Allahabad as well as at Lucknow will be changed. Both places may continue. Both places may be changed. Lucknow is the seat of the Government. Allahabad has also the history that the High Court was there before the order. Lucknow has been the principal place of oudh. The order aimed at giving status to the Chief Commissioner's Court as that of the High Court. It is difficult to foresee the future whether the authorities will change the location to other places but no idea of permanent seat can be read into the order. One can only say that it is the wish and hope that both Allahabad and Lucknow will be the two important seats so that history is not wiped out and policy is not changed. The conclusion of the High Court that the first proviso to paragraph 14 of the order means that the areas in oudh may be decreased is not the correct construction. The first proviso deals with nomination by the Chief Justice from time to time of not less than two Judges sitting at Lucknow. An argument was advanced on behalf of the Bar Association at Allahabad that the words \"not less than two in number\" indicate that the order did not contemplate the existence of a Division Bench. The words \"from time to time\" and \"not less than two innumber\" indicate the minimum as two and that more than two Judges may be there. The words \"from time to time\" suggest not only that Judges may come from Allahabad to Lucknow or vice versa but also that the number may be increased or decreased according to exigencies. The only limitation on the number is that it shall not be less than two. The High Court held that the Chief Justice might reduce the areas in Oudh because the words \"as the Chief Justice may direct\" occur immediately after the words \"in such areas in oudh\". This reason is fallacious. First, the words from time to time\" apply only to the nomination of Judges by the Chief Justice to sit at Lucknow and not to the words \"such areas in oudh as the Chief Justice may direct\". The important words in the first proviso to paragraph 14 of the order are \"such Judges of the new High Court, not less than two in number, as the Chief Justice, may, from time to time nominate, shall sit at Lucknow\". These words indicate that the power of the Chief Justice to nominate Judges, who shall sit at Lucknow, is to be exercised from time to time meaning thereby that the power can be exercised as often as may be necessary. Second, the words \"in respect of cases arising in such areas in oudh, as the Chief Justice may direct\" occur in the collocation of words \"that the Judges nominated shall sit at Lucknow in order to exercise in respect of cases arising in such areas in Oudh, as the Chief Justice may direct, the jurisdiction and power for the time being vested in the new High Court\". The words \"as the Chief Justice may direct\" mean that the Chief Justice exercises the power to direct what the areas in oudh are for exercise of jurisdiction by Judges at Lucknow Bench. Once that power is exercised it is exhausted. The reason is that the areas once determined should hold good on account of certainty and to dispel problems being created from time to time by increase or decrease of areas. The sum and substance as well as the spirit of the order is that under the first proviso to paragraph 14 Lucknow becomes the seat in respect of cases arising in areas in oudh. There is no other provision except paragraph 11 in the order as to what the areas in oudh are or will be. Historically, the territories with 12 Districts of Lucknow, Faizabad, Sultanpur, Rai Bareli, Pratap Garh, Barabanki, Gonda, Baharaich, Sitapur, Kheri, Hardoi and Unnao, were brought under the then British Crown within the jurisdiction of the Court of the Judicial Commissioner of oudh at Lucknow. This was under the Government of India order dated 4 February 1856. (See: Laws of non-Regulations Provinces 1863 by Lord G. Campell, Judicial Commissioner oudh). In 19 5 oudh Courts Act was passed by the Uttar Pradesh Legislature. The Chief Court (If oudh with only Chief Justice and four Puisne Judges was established replacing the Judicial Commissioners Court. In 1937 by the Government of India (Adaptation of Indian Laws) order 1937 it was provided that the Chief Court of Oudh shall consist of Chief Justice and such other Judges as may be appointed under the Government of India Act, 1935. Later, two more additional Judges were appointed. In this background theOrder of 1948 came into existence and the new High Court was established with its seats at Allahabad and Lucknow. It, therefore, follows that when the order came into existence, it was for the Chief Justice to direct the areas in oudh, which would be within the jurisdiction of the Lucknow Bench. Under paragraph 7 of the order, the new High Court has jurisdiction in respect of whole of the United Provinces exercisable in respect of any part of that province by either of the existing High Court. Paragraph 14 of the order deals with the seats of the High Court at Allahabad and Lucknow. It is only the first proviso to paragraph 14 of the order which states that unless the Governor of the United Provinces with the concurrence of the Chief Justice otherwise directs, not less than two Judges shall sit at Lucknow in order to exercise in respect of cases arising in such areas in oudh, the jurisdiction and power vested in the new High Court. The first proviso to paragraph 14 of the Orders specifies the instrumentality through which the jurisdiction vested in the new High Court will be exercised in respect of cases arising in oudh. The direction which the Chief Justice has given once with regard to the areas in oudh remains unaltered. Section 14 of the General Clauses Act states that where by any Act any power is conferred then unless a different intention appears, the power may be exercised from time to time as occasion requires. In the present case section 14 of General Clauses Act cannot have any application because a different intention appears in paragraph 14 of the order. The words \"from time to time\" occur in the first part of the first proviso to paragraph 14 of the order, in relation to the power of the Chief Justice to nominate Judges of the Lucknow Bench from time to time. The second part of the first proviso to paragraph 14 of the order which speaks of cases arising in such areas in oudh as the Chief Justice may direct do not attract the application of the words \"from time to time.\" The second part of the first proviso to paragraph 14 shows that such areas in oudh as the Chief Justice may direct are areas in respect of which once such direction is given, there is no intention in the order to exercise such power of direction from time to time. The conclusion of the High Court that the areas in oudh could be increased or decreased by the Chief Justice from time to time is set aside. It is only if Lucknow will ever cease to be a seat of the High Court when the Governor of the Uttar Pradesh with the concurrence of the Chief Justice so directs that the first proviso to paragraph 14 of the order both with regard to sitting of Judges at Lucknow and exercising jurisdiction in respect of cases arising in areas in oudh will cease to have any significance in relation to Lucknow. The meaning of the expression \"in respect of cases arising in such areas in oudh\" in the first proviso to paragraph 14 of the order was answered by the High Court that with regard to applications under Article 226 the same will be \"a case arising within the areas in oudh, only if the right of the petitioner in such an application arose first at a place within an area in oudh. The implication according to the High Court is that if the right of the petitioner arose first at any place outside any area in oudh and if the subsequent orders either in the revisional or appellate stage were passed by an authority within an area in oudh then in such cases the Lucknow Bench would not have any jurisdiction. The factor which weighed heavily with the High Court is that in most cases where an appeal or revision would lie to the State Government, the impugned order would be made at Lucknow and on that view practically all writ petitions would arise at Lucknow. The conclusion as well as the reasoning of the High Court is incorrect. It is unsound because the expression \"cause of action\" in an application under Article 226 would be as the expression is understood and if the cause of action arose because of the appellate order or the revisional order which came to be passed at Lucknow then Lucknow would have jurisdiction though the original order was passed at a place outside the areas in oudh. It may be that the original order was in favour of the person applying for a writ. In such case an adverse appellate order might be the cause of action. The expression \"cause of action is well-known. If the cause of action arises wholly or in part at a place within the specified oudh areas, the Lucknow Bench will have jurisdiction. If the cause of action arises wholly within the specified oudh areas, it is indisputable that the Lucknow Bench would have exclusive jurisdiction in such a matter. If the cause of action arises in part within the specified areas in oudh it would be open to the litigant who is the dominus litis to have his forum conveniens. The litigant has the right to go to a Court where part of his cause of action arises. In such cases, it is incorrect to say that the litigant chooses any particular Court. The choice is by reason of thejurisdiction of the Court being attracted by part of cause of action arising within the jurisdiction of the Court. Similarly, if the cause of action can be said to have arisen part within specified areas in oudh and part outside the specified oudh areas, the litigant will have the choice to institute proceedings either at Allahabad or Lucknow. The Court will find out in each case whether the jurisdiction of the Court rightly attracted by the alleged cause of action. To sum up. Our conclusions are as follows. First there is no permanent seat of the High Court at Allahabad. The seats at Allahabad and at Lucknow may be changed in accordance with the provisions of the order. Second, the Chief Justice of the High Court has no power to increase or decrease the areas in oudh from time to time. The areas in oudh have been determined once by the Chief Justice and, therefore, there is no scope for changing the areas. Third. the Chief Justice has power under the second proviso to paragraph 14 of the order to direct in his discretion that any case or class of cases arising in oudh areas shall be heard at Allahabad. Any case or class of cases are those which are instituted at Lucknow. The interpretation given by the High Court that the word \"heard\" confers powers on the Chief Justice to order that any case or class of cases arising in oudh areas shall be instituted or filed at Allahabad, instead of Lucknow is wrong. The word \"heard\" means that cases which have already been instituted or filed at Lucknow may in the discretion of the Chief Justice under the second proviso to paragraph 14 of the order he directed to be heard at Allahabad. Fourth, the expression \"cause of action\" with regard to a civil matter means that it should be left to the litigant to institute cases at Lucknow Bench or at Allahabad Bench according to the cause of action arising wholly or in part within either of the areas. If the cause of action arises wholly within oudh areas then the Lucknow Bench will have jurisdiction. Similarly, if the cause of action arises wholly outside the specified areas in oudh then Allahabad will have jurisdiction. If the cause of action in part arises in the specified oudh areas and part of the cause of action arises outside the specified areas, it will be open to the litigant to frame the case appropriately to attract the jurisdiction either at Lucknow or at Allahabad. Fifth, a criminal case arises where the offence has been committed or otherwise as provided in the Criminal Procedure Code. That will attract the jurisdiction of the Court at Allahabad or Lucknow. In some cases depending on the facts and the provision regarding jurisdiction, it may arise in either place. Applications under Article 226 will similarly lie either at Lucknow or at Allahabad as the applicant will allege that the whole of cause of action or part of the cause of action arose at Lucknow within the specified areas of oudh or part of the cause of action arose at a place outside the specified oudh areas. The answers given by the High Court to the first three questions are correct save as modified by our conclusions aforesaid. The answer given by the High Court to the fourth question is set aside. The meaning of cases arising in oudh areas will be found out by appropriate courts in the light of this judgment. The answer to the fifth question is discharged. The matters are sent back to the High Court for disposal in accordance with this judgment. Parties will Pay and bear their own costs. V.M.K.

Act 1951, from the judg- ment and order dated March 8, J972 of the Patna High Court in Election Petition No, 2 of 1971. D. V. Patel and U. P. Singh for the appellant, J. P. Goyal, Syama Prasad Mukherjee and R. A. Gupta, for respondent number 1. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MATHEW, J. This is an appeal under S. 116-A of the Represen- tation of the People Act, 1951, from a judgment of the HighCourt of Patna, by which the High Court dismissed the petition of the appellant for setting aside the election of Respondent number 1 as a Member of Parliament from 31-Khagaria Parliamentary Constituency, in the election held in March, 1971, and to declare the appellant as the duly elected member from the aforesaid constituency. According to the election programme, the nominations were to be filed from January 27, 1971 to February 3, 1971; they were to be scrutinized on February 4, 1971; poll, if necessary was to be taken on March 5, 1971; the ballot papers were to be counted on March 10, 1971 and the result of the election was to be declared on March 11, 1971. It was in pursuance to this programme that the appellant and Respondent number 1., along with 10 other candidates, filed their nomination papers. Two of the candidates subsequently withdrew and the contest was among the remaining candidates. The poll was held on March 5, 1971. The counting of the ballot papers took place on March 10, 1971. The respondent number 1 obtained 73,594 votes and the appellant, 73,046. So, Respondent number 1 was declared elected by the Returning Officer. The appellant challenged the election of respondent number 1 in her petition on the following allegations : There was no proper lighting arrangement in the segments where the votes were counted and there were frequent failures of electricity. Taking advantage of this, the counting staff showed partiality to respondent number 1 by counting the votes cast in favour of the other candidates for respondent number 1. Several undesirable persons who had been working for respondent number 1 managed to enter the counting compartments and created confusion. They also manoeuvred the counting staff and thereby illegally managed to increase the number of votes in favour of respondent number 1. Several ballot papers which had clear seal on the symbol of the appellant were illegally rejected. The counting staff took out several ballot papers of the appellant and mixed them with doubtful ballot papers and, without paying any heed to the objections raised by the counting agents of the appellant, rejected them mechanically by putting the rejection seal on their back. A large number of ballot papers which should have been rejected were counted in favour of respondent number 1. Ballot papers having seal on more than one symbol or seal on the shaded area or seal on the back or having no seal or having no official seal on the symbol of respondent number 1 were illegally counted in favour of respondent number 1. A large number of ballot papers bearing no signature of the Presid- ing Officer or identifying mark on the back were counted in favour of respondent number 1 merely because they had been placed in the ballot boxes illegally by those controlling the polling booths.Several bundles having less than 50 ballot papers were counted in favour of respondent number 1 as having 50 ballot papers. As a result of these irregularities in the counting of the ballot papers, about 3,000 ballot papers which should have been rejected were counted in favour of respondent number 1 and 1,000 ballot papers which should have been counted in favour of the appellant were illegally rejected and this materially affected the result of the election. To substantiate these allegations, the appellant examined as many as 23 witnesses including herself. After the evidence was closed, the appellant had put in a petition for inspection of the ballot papers. The High Court rejected the petition for the reason that the appellant had not pleaded the material facts in the petition to set aside the election. The High Court, after a careful consideration of the evidence of the witnesses found, that the allegations in the election petitions were vague and that evidence adduced to prove them was unreliable, and so, dismissed the petition. The appellant submitted before us that the evidence of the witnesses examined by her would prove the several illegalities alleged to have been committed in the counting of the ballot papers and that, in any event, the appellant's application for inspection should, have been allowed. We are satisfied that the High Court has taken into consideration all the material circumstances and has appreciated the evidence from the correct perspective. It has been the consistent practice of this Court not to interfere with findings on questions of fact unless there is some grave or palpable error in the appreciation of the evidence on the basis of which the findings were arrived at [see Dr. Jagjit Singh v. Giani Kartar Singh and Others(1). We also think that there is no substance in the contention of the appellant that the High Court was in error in rejecting her application for inspection of the ballot papers. As already stated, the High Court rejected the application for the reason that the allegations in the election petition were vague and that the petition did not contain an adequate statement of the material facts. In Ram Sewak Yadav v. Hussain Kamil Kidwai and others (2), this Court said that an order for inspection would not be granted as a matter of course : that having regard to the insistence upon the secrecy of the ballot papers, the Court would be justified in granting an order for inspection only where the petition for setting aside an election contains an adequate statement of the material facts on which the petitioner relies in support of his case and it is (1) A..I.R. 1966 S.C. 773. (2) [1964] 6 S.C.R. 238, 244.necessary to decide the dispute and to do complete justice between the parties. The Court also said that an order for inspection of ballot papers would not be granted to support vague pleas made in the petition not supported by material facts or to fish out evidence to support such pleas. The Court emphasized that mere allegations that the petitioner suspects or believes that there has been an improper reception, refusal or rejection of votes will not be sufficient to support an order for inspection. In Dr. Jagjit Singh v. Giani Kartar Singh and Others(1) this Court again said that an election petition should contain a concise statement of the material facts on which the petitioner relies, that vague or general allegations that valid votes were improperly rejected or invalid votes were improperly accepted, would not serve the purpose and that in ap plication made for the inspection of ballot boxes must give material facts which would enable the tribunal to consider whether, in the interests of justice, the ballot boxes should be inspected or not. The Court further said that in dealing with this question, the importance of the secrecy of the ballot papers cannot be ignored and that, it has always to be borne in mind that the statutory rules framed under the Act are intended to provide adequate safeguard for the examination of the validity or invalidity of votes and for their proper counting. The Court emphasized that in some cases, the ends of justice would make it necessary for the tribunal or Court to allow a party to inspect the ballot boxes and consider his objection about the improper acceptance or improper rejection of votes tendered by voters at any given election; but in considering the requirements of justice, care must be taken to see that election petitioners do not get a chance to make a roving or fishing enquiry into the ballot boxes so as to justify their claim that the returned candidate's election is void. In Jitendra Bahadur Singh v. Krishna Behari and Others(2) ,this Court observed that in view of the importance of maintaining .the secrecy of the ballot papers, scrutiny can only be ordered if the election-petition contains an adequate statement of the material facts on which the petitioner relies, that is, the material facts disclosed must afford an adequate basis for the allegations; and, the election tribunal must be prima facie satisfied that in order to decide the dispute and to do complete justice between the parties, inspection of the ballot papers is necessary. In the case at hand, the allegations in the election petition were vague and the petition did not contain an adequate statement of the material facts. The evidence adduced by the appellant to prove the allegations was found unreliable. No definite particulars were also given in the application for inspection as to the illegalities alleged to have been committed in the counting of the (1) A.I.R. [1966] S.C. 773, 783. (2) [1970] 1 S.C.R. 852.ballot papers. A recount will not be granted as a matter of right but only on the basis of evidence of good grounds for believing that there has been a mistake in the counting. It has to be decided in each case whether a prima facie ground has been made out for ordering an inspection. Counsel for the appellant relied on Bhim Sen v. Gomali(1) and contended that an inspection of the ballot papers should be granted even if no prima facie case has been made out by the allegations in the election petition. That case was considered by this Court in Ram Sewak Yadav v. Hussain Kamil Kidwai and ors. (2) and the Court was of the view that unless an election petition contains an adequate statement of the material facts, an election tribunal would not be justified in ordering an inspection of the ballot papers. As the appellant did not make out a case for inspection, the High Court was justified in dismissing the application. In these circumstances, we do not think that there is any substance in the prayer of the appellant for a recount of the votes. We dismiss the appeal with costs. G.C. Appeal dismissed..

February 22. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by AYYANGAR, J.-This appeal comes before us by virtue of a certificate of fitness granted under article 132 of the Constitution by the High Court of Patna. The question involved in the -appeal is a short one but is of considerable public importance and of great constitutional significance. It is concerned with the Constitutional validity of r. 4-A, which was introduced into the Bihar Government Servants'Conduct Rules, 1956, by a notification of the Governor of Bihar dated August 16, 1957 and reads : \"4-A. Demonstrations and strikes.- No Government servant shall participate in any demonstration or resort to any form of strike in connection with any matter pertaining to his conditions of service.\" Very soon after this rule was notified the six appellants, the first of whom is the President of the Patna Secretariat Ministerial Officers' Association and the others are Assistants or Clerks under the Bihar State Government, filed on August 26, 1957, a petition before the High Court of Patna under article 226 of the Constitution challenging the validity of the rule on various grounds including inter alia that it interfered with the rights guaranteed to the petitioners by sub-cls. (a), (b) and (c) of clause (1) of Art. 19 of the Constitution of India and that in consequence the rule was in excess of the rulemaking power conferred by Art. 309 of the Constitution which was the source of the authority enabling service-rules to be framed. They prayed for an order restraining the respondent-State from giving effect to the rule and to desist from interfering with the petitioners' right to go on strike or to hold demonstrations. The learned Judges of the High Court who heard the petition were of the opinion that the freedom guaranteed under article 19(1)(a) and 19(1)(c) of the Constitution did not include a right to resort to a strike or the right to demonstrate so far as servants of Government were concerned. The learned Judges however, further considered the validity of the rule on the assumption that the freedoms enumerated in sub-cls. (a) and (c) of Art. 19(1) did include those rights. On this basis they held that the rule impugned was saved as being reasonable restraints on these guaranteed freedoms.The learned Judges therefore directed the petition to be dismissed, but on application by the appellants they granted a certificate under article 132 of the Constitution to enable them to approach this Court. At this stage it is necessary to mention that a similar conclusion as the one by the High Court of Patna now under appeal was reached by the learned Judges of the High Court of Bombay before whom the constitutional validity of a, rule in identical terms as r. 4A of the Bihar Rules was impugned. The correctness of that decision is under challenge in this Court in S.L. Ps. (Civil) numbers 499 and 500 of 1961 and the appellants in that appeal sought leave to intervene in this appeal and we have permitted them to do so, and we heard Mr. Chari-learned Counsel for the interveners in further support of the appeal. Before entering on a discussion of the arguments advanced before us it might be convenient to state certain matters which are common ground and not in controversy : (1) The impugned rule 4-A was framed under article 309 of the Constitution which enacts, to quote the material words: \"309. Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, Acts of the appropriate Legisla- ture may regulate the recruitment, and condi- tions of service of persons appointed, to public services................. and provision is made by the proviso to the Article for the Governors of States to make rules until ,,provision in that behalf is made by or under an Act of the appropriate Legislature\". We are' drawing attention to the Article under which the rule is made for the purpose of pointing out that the rulemaking power being subject to the Constitution, the validity of the rule would have to be tested by the same criteria as are applicable to all laws and subordinate legislation. In other words, if there are any constitutional limitations upon lawmaking, such of them as are appropriate to the subject dealt with by the rule would be applicable to them. (2)It would be seen that the rule prohibits two types of activities, both in connection with matters pertaining to the conditions of service (i) the holding of demonstrations, and (ii) resort to strikes to achieve the purpose indicated. This -Court had, in All India Bank Employees' Association v. National Industrial Tribunal (1) (Bank disputes Bombay etc.), to consider the question as to whether the right to form an association guaranteed by article 19(1) (c) involved or implied the right to resort to a strike and answered it in the negative. In view of this decision learned Counsel for the appellants, as also Mr. Chari for. the interveners confined their arguments to the question of the legality of the provision as regards the right ,,,to hold demons- trations\". The validity of the rule therefore in so far as it prohibits strikes, is no longer under challenge. The argument addressed to us on behalf of the appellants may be shortly stated thus : The servicerule being one framed under article 309 is a \"law\" within the definition of Art. 13(3) of the Constitution and it would have to be pronounced invalid to the extent that it is inconsistent with the provisions of Part III of the Constitution . article 13(2). Article 19(1) confers on all citizens the right by sub-cl. (a) to freedom of speech and expression, and by sub-clause (b) to assemble peacefully and without arms, and the right to \"demonstrate\"would be covered by these two sub-clauses. By the mere fact that a person enters Government service, be does not cease to be \"a citizen of India\", nor does that disentitle him to claim the freedoms guaranteed to every citizen. In fact, article 33 which enacts : \"Parliament may by law determine to (1) CA, 154 of 1961 (Not yet reported). what extent any of the rights conferred by this Part shall, in their application to the members of the Armed Forces or the Forces charged with maintenance of public order, be restricted or abrogated so as to ensure the proper discharge of their duties and the main- tenance of discipline among them.\" obviously proceeds on the basis of persons in the service of Government being entitled to the Protection of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution and is inserted to enable special provision being made for the abrogation, if necessary, of the guaranteed freedoms in the case of two special services only, viz., the army and the police force. The approach to the question regarding the constitutionality of the rule should be whether the ban that it imposes on demonstrations would be covered by the limitation of the guaranteed rights contained in article 19(2) and 19(3). In regard to both these clauses the only relevant criteria which has been suggested by the respondent-State is that the rule is framed -in the interest of public order\". A demonstration may be defined as \"an expression of one's feelings by outward signs\". A demonstration such as is prohibited by, the rule may be of the most innocent type- peaceful orderly such as the mere wearing of a badge by a Government servant or even by a silent assembly say outside office hours-demonstrations which could in no sense be suggested to involve any breach of tranquillity, or of a type involving incitement to or capable of leading to disorder. If the rule had confined itself to demonstrations of type which would lead to disorder then the validity of that rule could have been sustained but what the rule does is the imposition of a blanket-ban on all demonstrations of whatever type-innocent as well as otherwise-and in consequence its validity cannot be upheld. Before considering these arguments of learnedCounsel it is necessary to deal with the submission by Mr. Sen who appeared for the Union of India who intervened in this appeal which, if accepted, would cut at the root of the entire argument for the appellant. He endeavoured to persuade us to hold that though the power to frame Service Rules under article 309 was subject to the Constitution with. the result that the rules so framed ought not to -be contrary to any constitutional provision, still it did not follow that every one of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III could be claimed by a Government servant. He urged that as a person voluntarily entered Government service he must by that very act be demeed to have consented to enter that service in such reasonable conditions as might be framed for ensuring the proper working of the administrative machinery of the Government and for the proper maintenance of discipline in the Service itself. Under article 310 every office is held, subject to the provisions of the Constitution, at the pleasure of the President or of the Governor as the case may be, and provided a rule regulating the conditions of service was reasonable and was calculated to ensure the purposes above- named he submitted that its reasonableness and validity could not be tested solely by reference to the criteria laid down in cls.(2), (3) or (4) of article 19. In this connection we were referred to a few decisions of the American Courts for the proposition that the constitutionality of special rules enacted for the discipline of those in the service of Government bad to be tested by criteria different from those applicable to ordinary citzens. Thus in Ex Parte: Curtis (1) the constitutionality of a law prohibiting officers or employees of the United States from '(requesting, giving to or receiving from any other officer or employee of the government any money or property or other thing of value for political purposes,\" under a penalty of being discharged and, on conviction fined, was upheld. In the majority (1) 27 Law. Ed. 232, 106 U. S. 371. judgment which was delivered by Waite, C.J., the reasonableness of such a rule is pointed out. It is however manifest that no fundamental right could be claimed to have been infringed by the provision there impugned. In United Public Workers v. Mitchell(1), which was another case to which our attention was invited, one of the questions raised related to the validity of an Act of Congress (The Hatch Act, 1940) making it unlawful for the employees in the Executive Branch of the Federal Government to take part in political campaigns and making the same the basis for disciplinary departmental action. It was contended tbat this was an interference with the right of free speech as well as with political rights. Keed, J., who spoke for the majority observed: \"The interference with free expression has to be seen in comparison with the requirements of orderly management of administrative personnel....... .... We accept appellant's contention that the nature of political rights reserved to the people are involved. The right claimed as inviolate may be stated as the right of a citizen to act as a party official or worker to further his own political views. Thus we have a measure of interference by the Hatch Act and the Rules with what otherwise would be the freedom of the civil servant under the First Amendment. And, if we look upon due process as a guarantee of freedom in those fields, there is a corresponding impairment of that right under the Fifth Amendment................ We do not find persuation in appellants' argument that such activities during free time are not subject to regulation even though admittedly political activites cannot be indulged in during working hours. The influence of political activity by government employees, if evil in its effects on the (1) 91 Law -Ed. 754, 330 U.S. 75. service, the employees or people dealing with them, is hardly less so because that activity takes place after hours............ It is accepted constitutional doctrine that these fundamental human rights are not absolutes............ The essential rights of the First Amendment are subject to the elemental need for order without which the guarantees, of civil rights to others would be a mockery\". Mr. Sen also referred us to Mc Auliffe v. New Bedford (1) which is cited at p.791 in 91' Law. Ed. in support of the position that servants of Government formed a class and that conditions of service imposed upon them which are reasonable and necessary to ensure efficiency and discipline cannot be questioned on the ground of their contravening any constitutional guarantees. Mr. Sen drew our attention in particular to the following passage in. the judgment of Holmes, J.: \"There is nothing in the Constitution or the statute to prevent the city from attaching obedience to this rule as a condition to the office of policeman, and making it part of the good conduct required. The petitioner may have a constitutional right to talk politics, -but he has no constitutional right to be a policeman. There are few employments for hire in which the, servant does not agree to suspend his constitutional right of free speech, as well as of idleness, by the-implied terms of his contract. The servant cannot complain, as he takes the employment on the terms which are offered him. On the same principle, the city may impose any reasonable condition upon holding offices within its control. This condition seems to us reasonable, if that be a question open to revision here (The Police Regulation prohibiting members of the depart- (1) (1892) 155 Mass. 216. ment from soliciting money etc. for political purposes)\". As regards these decisions of the American Courts, it should be borne in mind that though the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United State reading \"Congress shall make no law......... abridging the freedom of speech........... appears to confer no power on the Congress to impose any restriction on the exercise of the guaranteed right, still it has always been understood that the freedom guaranteed is subject to the' police power --the scope. of which however has not been defined with precision or uniformly. It is on the basis of the police power to abridge that freedom that the constitutional validity of lawa penalising libels, and those relating to sedition, or to obscene publications etc., has been sustained. The resultant flexibility of the restrictions that could be validly imposed renders the American decisions inapplicable to and without must use for resolving the questions arising under article 19(1)(a) or (b) of our Constitution wherein the grounds, on which limitations might be placed on the guaranteed right are set out with definiteness and precision. Learned Counsel invited our attention also to the decision of this Court in Balakotaiah v.Union of India (1) to a similar effect. But it must however, be noted that in Balakotaiah's case the validity of the rule was not challenged. In further support of his submission that the freedoms guaranteed to citizens by article 19 cannot in their very nature, be applied to those who are employed in government service out attention was invited to sub-cls. (d), (e) and (g) of clause (1). It was said that a Government servant who was posted to a particular place could obviously riot exercise the freedom to move throughout the territory of India and similarly, his right to reside and settle in any part of India could be said to be violated by his (1) [1958]S.C.R.1052. being posted to any particular place. Similarly, so long as he was in government service he would not be entitled to practicise any profession or trade and it was therefore urged that to hold that these freedoms guaranteed under Art. 19 were applicable to government servants would render public service or administration impossible. This line of argument, however, does not take into account the limitations which might be imposed on the exercise of these rights by cls. (5) and (6) under which res' trictions on the exercise of the rights conferred by sub-cls. (d) and (g) may be imposed if reasonable in the interest of the general public. In this connection he laid stress on the fact that speial provision had been made in regard to Service underthe State in some of the Articles in Partlll-such as for instance articles 15, 16 and 18(3) and (4)-and he desired us therefrom to draw the inference that the other Articles in which there was no specific reference to Government servants were inapplicable to them. He realised however, that the implication arising from article 33 would run counter to this line of argument but as regards this Article his submission was that it was concerned solely to save Army Regulations which permitted detention in a manner which would not be countenanced by article 22 of the Constitution. We find ourselves unable to accept the argument that the Constitution excludes Government servants as a class from the protection of the several rights guaranteed by the several Articles in Part III save in those cases where such persons were specifically named. In our opinion, this argument even if otherwise possible, has to be repelled in view of the terms of article 33. That Article- selects two of the Services under the State-members of the armed forces charged with the maintenance of public order and saves the rules prescribing the conditions of service in regard to them-from invalidity on the ground of violation of-any of the fundamentalrights guaranteed by Part III and also defines the purpose for which such abrogation or restriction migeht take place, this being limited to ensure the proper discharge of duties and the maintenance of discipline among them. The Article having thus selected the Services members of which might be, deprived of the benefit of the fundamental rights guaranteed to other persons and citizens and also having prescribed the limits within which such restrictions or abrogation might take place, we consider that other classes of servants of Govern. ment in common with other persons and other citizens of the country cannot be excluded from the protection of the rights guaranteed by Part III by reason merely of their being Government servants and the nature and incidents of the duties which they have to discharge in that capacity might necessarily involve restrictions of certain freedoms as we have pointed out in relation to article 19 (1) (e) and (g). The first question that falls to be considered is whether the right to make a \",demonstration\" is covered by either or both of the two freedoms guaranteed by article 19(1)(a) and 19(1)(b). A \"'demonstration\" is defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary as \"an outward exhibition of feeling, as an exhibition of opinion on political or other question especially a public meeting or procession\". In Webster it is defined as \"a public exhibition by a party, sect or society......... as by a parade or mass-meeting\". Without going very much into the niceties of language it might be broadly stated that a demonstration is a visible manifestation of the feelings or sentiments of an individual or a group. It is thus a communication of one's ideas to others to whom it is intended to be conveyed. It is in effect therefore a form of speech or of expression, because speech need not be vocal since signs made by a dumb person would also be a form of speech. It has however to be recognised thatthe argument before us is confined to the rule prohibiting demonstration which is a form of speech and expression or of a mere assembly and speeches therein and not other forms of demonstration which do not fall within the content of Art. 19(1)(a) or 19(1)(b). A demonstration might take the form of an assembly and even then the intention is to convey to the person or authority to whom the communication is intended the feelings of the group which assembles. It necessarily follows that there are forms of demonstration which would fall within the freedoms guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(a) and 19(1) (b).It is needless to add that from the very nature of things a demonstration may take various forms; It may be noisy and disorderly, for instance stone- throwing by a crowd may be cited as an example of a violent and disorderly demonstration and this would not obviously be within article 19(1)(a) or (b). It can equally be peaceful and orderly such as happens when the members of the group merely wear some badge drawing attention to their grievances. If thus particular forms of demonstration fall within the scope of article 19(1)(a) or 19(1)(b), the next question is whether r. 4-A, in so far as it lays an embargo on any form of demonstration for the redress of the grievances of Government employees, could be sustained as falling within the scope of article 19(2) and (3). These clauses run: \"19. (2) Nothing in sub-clause (a) of clause (1) shall affect the operation of any existing law, or prevent the State from making any law in so far as such law imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub-clause in the interests of the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality or in relation to contempt of court defamation or incitement to an offence. (3)Nothing in sub-clause (b) of the said clause shall affect the operation of any exis- ting law in so far as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, in the interests of public order' reasonable restrictions on the exercise Of the right con- ferred by the said sub-clause.\" The learned Judges of the High Court have, -as stated earlier, upheld the validity of the rule by considering them as reasonable restrictions in the interest of public order. In coming to this conclusion the learned Judges of the High Court did not have the benefit of the exposition of the meaning of the expression in the interest of public order\" in these two clauses by this Court in Superintendent, Central Prison, Fatehgarh v. Ram Manohar Lohia (1). Speaking for the Court Subba Rao, J., summarised his conclusion on the point in these terms: \"Public order (article 19(2) and (3)) is synonymous with 'public safety and tranquillity. It is the absence of disorder involving breaches of local significance in contradistinction to national upheavals such as revolution, civil strike, war affecting the security of the State.\" The learned Judge further stated that in order that a legislation may be \"in the interests of public order\" there must be a proximate and reasonable nexus between the nature of the speech prohibited and public order. The learned Judge rejected the argument that the phrase \"in the interests of public order\" which is wider than the words ',for the maintenance of public order\" which were found in the Article as originally enacted-thereby sanctioned the enactment of a law which restricted the right merely because the speech had a tendency however (1) [1960) 2 S.C.R. 821.remote to disturb public order. The connection has to be intimate, real and rational. The validity of the rule now impugned has to be judged with reference to tests here propounded. If one had to consider the propriety of the rule as one intended to ensure proper discipline apart from the limitations on law-making, in a Government servant and in the context of the other provisions made for the making of representations and for the redress of services, grievances, and apart from the limitiations imposed by the Constitution there could be very little doubt nor would it be even open to argument that the rule now impugned was both reasonable and calculated to ensure discipline in the Services and in that sense conducive to ensure efficiency in the Service. Based on this aspect of the function of the rule the argument as regards article 1 9(2) & (3) was put on a twofold basis: (1) that the maintenance of public order was directly dependent upon the existence of a body of Government ser- vants who were themselves subject to strict discipline. In other words, the maintenance of discipline among Government servants not only contributed to the maintenance of public order but was a sine qua non of public order. (2) The other aspect in which it was presented was the negative of the one just now mentioned that if Government servants were ill- disciplined and were themselves to agitate in a disorderly manner for the redress of their service grievances, this must lead to a demoralisation of the public and would be reflected in the disappearance of public order. We find ourselves unable to uphold this submission on behalf the State. In the first place we are not here concerned with any rule for ensuring discipline among the police, which is the arm of the law primarily charged with the maintenance of public order. The threat to public order should therefore arise from the nature of the demonstration prohibited. No doubt, if the rule were so framedas to single out those types of demonstration which were likely to lead to a disturbance of public tranquillity or which 'Would fall under the other limiting criteria specified in article 19(2) the validity of the rule could have been sustained. The vice of the rule, in our opinion, consists in this that it lays a ban on every type of demonstration--be the same however innocent and however incapable of causing a breach of public tranquillity and does not confine itself to those forms of demonstrations which might lead to that result. Learned Counsel for the respondent and those who supported the validity of the rule could not suggest that on the language of the rule as -it stood, it was possible to read it as to separate the legal from the unconstitutional portion of the provision. As no such separation is possible the entire rule has to be struck down as unconstitutional. We have rejected the broad contention that persons in the service of government form a class apart to whom the rights guaranteed by Part III do not, in general, apply. By accepting the contention that the freedoms guaranteed by Part III and in particular those in article 19(1)(a) apply to the servants of government we should not be taken to imply that in, relation to this class of citizen 'the ,responsibility arising from official position would not by itself impose some limitations on the exercise of their rights as citizens. For instance, s.54(2) of the Income-tax Act, 1922, enacts: \"If a public servant discloses any parti- culars . contained in any such statement, return, accounts, documents, evidence affi- davit, deposition or record, he shall be punishable 'with imprisonment which may extend to six months, and shall also be liable to fine.\" Section 128(1) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, enjoins on every officer, clerk, agent etc. Who performs any duty in connection, with therecording or counting of votes at an election shall maintain the secrecy of the voting and shall not communicate to any person any information calouluted to violate such secrecy, and visits the breach of the rule by punishment with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three. months or with fine. It cannot be contended that provisions on these or similar lines in these or other enactments restrict the freedom of the officers etc. merely because they are prohibited from communicating information which comes to them in the course of the performance of the duties of their office, to others. The information having been obtained by them in the course of their duties by virtue of their official position, rules or provisions of the law prescribing the circumstances in which alone such information might be given out or used do not infringe the right of freedom of speech as is guaranteed by the Con- stitution. We would therefore allow the appeal in part and grant the appellants a declaration that r. 4A in the form in which it now stands prohibiting \"any form of demonstrations is violative of the appellants' rights under article 19(1)(a) & (b) and should therefore be stuck down. It is only necessary to add that the rule, in so far as it prohibits a strike, cannot be struck (own since there is no fundamental right to resort to a strike. As the appellants have succeeded only in part, there will be no order as to costs in the appeal.

Ramaya, A.I.R. 1977 S.C. 1474, referred to. & ORIGINAL JURISDICTION : Writ Petition (C) number 1438 of 1981. (Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.) Vijay K. Jain, Baldev Atreya and S. Shekhar for the Petitioners. V.C. Mahajan, Ms. Sarla Chandra, V.K. Verma and Ashok Bhan for the Respondents. Ashok Grover (NP) for the intervenor. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by B.P. JEEVAN REDDY, J. This writ petition is an instance of the classic dispute between promotees and direct recruits. The writ petitoners are Assistant Engineers in the Central Engineering Service-Class III (Gazetted Officers) in the Central Public Works Department (C.P.W.D.). Appointment to the category of Assistant Engineers' Serivce is governed by the Central Engineering Service, Class-II Recruitment Rules, 1954 (hereinafter referred to as `1954 rules'). These Rules, are divided into six parts. Part I is general. It contains the interpretation clause. Part-II deals with the method of recruitment. Rules 3 to 5, relevant for our purpose occur in this part. The Rules before their amendment in 1977 and 1978 read as follows: \"3. Recruitment to the Service shall be made by any of the following method:- (a) By competitive examination in India in accordance with Part III of these Rules. (b) By direct appointment in accordance with Part IV of these Rules of persons selected in India otherwise than by competitive examination. (c) By promotion in accordance with Part V of these Rules. (d) By transfer in accordance with Part VI of these Rules.\" \"4.(a) All appointments to the service or to posts borne upon the cadre of the Service shall be made by the Government. (b) No appointment shall be made to the Service or to any post borne upon the cadre of the Service by any method not specified in Rule 3. (c) Subject to the provisions of sub-rule (b), the method or methods of recruitment to be employed for the purpose of filling any particular vacancies in the Service or such vacancies therein as may be required to be filled during any particular period and the number of candidates to be recruited by each method shall be determined by the Government. 5. Appointments to the Service made otherwise than by promotion will be subject to orders issued from time to time by the Ministry of Home Affairs regarding special representation in the Services for specific sections of the people\". Rule 3 thus provided for four methods of appointment namely, (a) by competitive examination held in accordance with Part III of the said rules, which means an examination conducted by the U.P.S.C Rule 21 which occurs in Part III provides that the candidates selected under this part shall be appointed as Assistant Engineers on probation for two years and if considered fit for permanent appointment, they will be confirmed in their appointments; (b) by direct appointment in accordance with Part IV of these Rules i.e., otherwise than by competitive examination. Rule 23 occurred in Part IV. Recruitment by selection under this rule was to be made \" from among temporary engineers and temporary section officers employed on the civil engineering side of the Central Public Works Department after consultation with the Commission.\" The proviso to Rule 23(1), however, provided that it is not necessary to consult the commission in the case of any person, if the commission were consulted in connected with his temporary appointment to the service. The eligibility criteria are the same as is provided for appointment under method (a) except in the matter of age. The age of the candidate should not be more than 40 years; (c) by promotion in accordance with Part V. Rule 24 is the only rule occuring in Part V. It reads \"recruitment by promotion shall be made by selection on the basis of merit from among permanent section officers employed in the civil engineering side of the Central Public Works Department.\" (d) by transfer in accordance with Part VI of the said rules. Part VI again contained a solitary rule - Rule 25. We need not refer to this rule since it is not relevant for our purpose. Rule 4 provided that no appointment shall be made to the service except in the manner prescribed by Rule 3. Clause (c) of Rule 4, however, empowers the Central Government to determine the number of candidates to be recruited by each method, among other matters. After the coming into force of 1954 Rules, appointments were being made from different sources from time to time. In the matter of confirmation, however, the authorities followed a particular method which gave rise to discontent and disquiet among certain sections leading to the filing of a writ petition in the Delhi High Court, being Civil Writ Petition number 238 of 1969. It is necessary to briefly notice the facts of this writ petition and the principle enunciated by the Full Bench of the Delhi High Court while disposing it, as also the decision of this court on appeal reported as Jagmal Singh Yadav v. M. Ramaya A.I.R. (1977) S.C. 1474. Writ Petition number 238 of 1969 was filed by 12 Assistant Engineers who were appointed as Assistant Engineers on various dates between 18th October, 1958 and 8th January, 1963 to officiate temporarily until further orders. The respondent numbers 1, 2 and 3 to the writ petition were the Union of India, U.P.S.C. and another official respondent. Respondents 4 to 51 were recruited directly under clause (a) of Rule 3 read with Part III i.e., by competitive examination held by U.P.S.C., while respondent 62 to 99 were recruited directly under clause (b) of Rule 3 read with Part IV i.e., in consultation with the U.P.S.C. but otherwise than by holding competitive examination. The case of the petitioners was that prior to their appointment as Assistant Engineers they were working as temporary section officers in C.P.W.D. (in the subordinate engineering services, Class-III Non-gazetted) and that they were appointed as Assistant Engineers in accordance with clause (b) of Rule 3 read with Part IV of 1954 Rules. Their grievance was that though respondents 4 to 99 were appointed subsequent to them, they have been confirmed in the category of Assistant Engineers leaving the writ petitioner unconfirmed. They submitted that they were entitled to be confirmed prior to or at any rate along with the said respondents. On behalf of the respondents, it was submitted that the writ petitioners therein were not appointed under clause (b) of Rule 3 read with Part IV but under clause (c) of Rule 3 read with Part V. It was also submitted that the writ petitioners were appointed \"to officiate temporarily and until further orders\" as Assistant Engineers and, therefore, they cannot claim parity with respondents 4 to 99. The writ petition was heard by a Full Bench of the Delhi High Court which allowed the writ petition in the following terms: (1) The writ petitioners were, and must be deemed to have been, appointed under clause (b) of Rule 3 read with Part IV and not under clause (c) of Rule 3 read with Part V. At the time of their appointment, they held the same qualifications as the respondents. (2) That the petitioners in the said writ petition and other persons similarly situated like them. Who had joined the service earlier, should be confirmed first according to the dates of joining the service as Assistant Engineers, after giving weightage, in preference to the respondents therein. (3) That there was no final determination of quota as contemplated by Rule 4(c) between the four methods/sources of recruitment specified in Rule 3. Fixation of quota was a matter still under consideration of the Central Government but no final decision was taken till the rendering of decision by the High Court. (4) The writ petitioners did not really question the validity of the appointment of any of the respondents 4 to 99 but only the validity of their confirmation. It is, however, not necessary to set aside their confirmation for giving relief to the writ petitioners in the circumstances of the case. The operative portion and the direction issued by the High Court is better to put in their own words: \"For the foregoing reasons we hold that the petitioners were appointed as temporary Assistant Engineers rule 3(b) read with part IV (rule 23) and were entitled to be considered for confirmation as Assistant Engineer when many of the respondents were confirmed. Since they were not so considered it would normally follow that the confirmation of the said respondents will have to be set aside if the vacancies available at the relevant time were less than the eligible persons including the petitioners and the confirmed respondents. We have already pointed out that Mr. Gopal Krishan stated before us on behalf of the petitioners that they do not question the validity of the appointment of any of the respondents numbers 4 to 99 but that the petitioners question the validity of the confirmation of those of the respondents who have been confirmed. However we consider that it is not necessary to set aside the said confirmation of the following reasons: Mr. Gopalan Krishanan stated before us that out of the sanctioned number of post of Assistant Engineer, a large number of posts have remained vacant and they will be more than sufficient to accommodate the petitioners in case they are confirmed. The correctness of this statement was not disputed by the counsel for the respondent. In other words there are a sufficiently large number of vacant posts for accommodating the petitioners if they are considered and confirmed. It is thus not necessary and we are not inclined to disturb the existing situation by setting aside or questioning the confirmation of these respondents who have been confirmed. In the result, we allow the writ petition partly and direct the respondents (1) to (3) to consider the petitioner for confirmation as Assistant Engineer, and to adjust the inter se seniority of such of the petitioners as might be confirmed after consideration and the respondents in accordance with law. In the circumstances of the case we direct the parties to bear their own costs in the writ petition.\" No appeal was preferred against the said judgment by the Union of India. However, one of the contesting respondents viz., respondent number 51 in the writ petition approached this Court questioning the correctness of the said decision. This court, in the decision referred to above, agreed with the High Court that the writ petitioners in the said writ petition must be deemed to have been appointed under Rule 3(b) read with part IV of the Rules inasmuch as the Committee which selected them was presided over by a member of the U.P.S.C. This court also agreed with the High Court that there was no final determination by the Union of India on the question of inter se quota as between the four sources/channels of recruitment specified in Rule 3. Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed. While dismissing the appeal, this court made the following observations in the penultimate para of its judgment: \"Before parting with the records we consider it proper to point out that persons entering Government service have the right to know where they stand with regard to their conditions of service and future promotion. Since there is no impediment in the way of the Government to make appropriate rules regarding conditions of service, even retrospectively, subject to constitu- tionality, keeping in view justice and fair play to all concerned, it is a sorry sight to find that officers in the same Service fight over the years in courts having failed to get redress from the Government. When officers are qualified to hold certain posts after recruitment, according to rules, and they have put in a number of years, without break, in the service to the satisfaction of the authorities, it is impermissible to invoke a recondite rule and call it in aid to deprive a large section of officers of the benefit of otherwise satisfactory service. The matter may be different when posts in the Service are abolished, appointments to the Service are transitory or fortuitous or incumbents are found unsuitable for absorption. The history of this Service is that temporary posts are first created and then after some years they are converted into permanent posts. The Government, therefore, cannot merely be an on- looker where it could rightly claim to be a legitimate arbiter on its own authority and having proper regard to all just claims. We also cannot held feeling that thinking in the Ministry has not always been uniform, sympathy warning or waxing form time to time for reasons not always manifest.\" The petitioners in C.W.P.238/69, it may be noted, were not promotees. They contended - an which contention was upheld by the Delhi High Court and this court - that they are direct recruits having been appointed under Rule 3(b) read with part IV of 1954 Rule. Respondents 4 to 99 to that writ petition were also direct recruits - some of them having been appointed under Rule 3(a) read with part II and the others under Rule 3(b) read with part IV. It was thus not a dispute between promotees and direct recruits - as the Rules then stood - but as between two categories of direct recruits. In fact, a large number of respondents appointed under Rule 3(b) were in the same position as the writ petitioners therein. The Respondents, no doubt, had contended that the writ petitioners therein were promotees appointed under Rule 3(c) read with part V but that contention was rejected. After the judgment of the Delhi High Court in writ petition number 238 of 1969 (in November, 1971) the Central Government prepared a seniority list of Assistant Engineers in the year 1972, based on the date of appointment/promotion, and communicated to all concerned inviting objections, if any, thereto. Before the said provisional seniority list could be finalised, this court rendered its decision in the appeal on 6th January, 1977. Now what happened after the pronouncement of the said judgment by this court is very significant. On 17th January, 1977, the Central Government (President) issued GSR 168 amending the 1954 Rule called Central Engineering Service, Class II, Recruitment (Amendment) Rules 1976. By clause (b) of Rule 2 of these Amendment Rules, Rule 24 was substituted altogether. After its substitution, Rule 24 reads as follows: \"24. Recruitment by promotion shall be made (i) 50% by selection on the basis of merit from among permanent Junior Engineers employed on the Civil Engineering side of the Central Public Works Department; and (ii) 50% by selection from among Junior Engineers employed on the Civil Engineering side of the Central Public Works Department, after consultation with the Union Public Service Commission on the basis of a limited Departmental Competitive Examination which shall be held in accordance with the rules to be made by the Central Government, after consultation with the Union Public Service Commission.\" It may be noted that Rule 24 in part V was relatable to clause (c) of Rule 3, which dealt with promotion. Now by virtue of the above amendment, the category covered by clause (b) of Rule 3 was sought to be brought within the preview of Rule 24, without correspondingly amending Rule 23 or Rule 3(b). In other words, the Assistant Engineers who were appointed by direct recruitment from among temporary engineers and temporary section officers after consultation with Public Service Commission were sought to be treated as promotees. Evidently, the above amendments were issued in some haste without a proper scrutiny which is evident from the fact that only Rule 24 was amended without correspondingly amending other Rules in the 1954 Rules. When this was realised, it is evident, the Central Government came forward with yet another set of amendment Rules contained in GSR 418 dated 8th March, 1978. Now, by these Amendment Rules (1978 Amendment Rules) Rule 3 was substituted altogether. Instead of four channels/sources/methods of recruitment, they became only two viz., direct recruitment and promotion. As substituted, Rule 3 read as follows: \"3. Recruitment to the service shall be made by way of the following methods:- (a) by competitive examination in India in accordance with Part III of these Rules. (b) by promotion in accordance with part IV of these Rules.\" To be consistent with the amendment to Rule 3, certain other amendments were also made. They were: (a) part IV containing Rule 23 was omitted; (b) part V and Rule 24 therein were renumbered as part IV and Rule 23 respectively; and (c) part IV containing Rule 25 was omitted. Similar amendments were made with respect to Electrical Engineering Service. The net effect of the 1977 and 1978 amendments was this: (i) only the Assistant Engineers recruited in accordance with unamended clause (a) of Rule 3 (also clause (a) of Rule 3 after amendment) read with part III were to be treated as direct recruits. (ii) recruitment by transfer as provided earlier by clause (d) of Rule read with part VI was deleted altogether; and (iii) Assistant Engineers appointed under clause (b) read with Rule 23 (part IV) and those appointed under clause (c) read with Rule 24 (part V) were clubbed together and called/treated as promotees with equal quota as between them. It is worth recalling that clause (b) of Rule 3, as it stood before the said Amendment, expressly termed those appointed thereunder as direct recruits. The matters did not stop there. Purporting to draw inspiration from the observations contained in the penultimate para of the judgment of this court in A.I.R. 1977 S.C. 1474, the Central Government framed a new set of rules called \"Central Public Works Department Assistant Engineers (Central Engineering Service and Central Electrical Service) Group B (confirmation and seniority) Rules, 1979. \"Though these rules were issued in January, 1979 they were given retrospective effect from 21st May, 1954 i.e., the date on which the 1954 Rules were brought into force. Since the validity of these rules - as amended in 1982 - is the main issue in this writ petition it would be appropriate to notice these Rules. Rule 2 is the definition clause. Clause (a) defines the expression \"appointed day\" to mean 21st May, 1954. The expression \"Service Rules\" defined in Clause (b) refer to the 1954 Rules. Sub-rule (2) of Rule 2 says that the words and expressions not defined in this rule shall carry the same meaning as is assigned to them in the service Rules. Rule 3 provides that every member of service whether appointed by direct recruitment, by promotion or by transfer shall be on probation for a period of two years unless the period of probation has already been approved by the Government under Service Rules. Rules 4 and 5 which dealt with confirmation and seniority respectively constituted the central theme of these rules. It is, however, not necessary to set out these Rules inasmuch as they have been totally substituted in 1982. Suffice it to state that Seniority was to be determined with reference to the date of confirmation and the date of confirmation was determined in a particular manner, to be elaborated hereinafter - and not with reference to the date of appointment or date of promotion, as the case may be. Actually, the purport of the Rules remains the same even after amendment. Even so, it would be sufficient if we refer to Rules 4 & 5 as substituted in 1982. But before we refer to 1982 Amendment Rules, which were framed and issued after the filing of the writ petition, it is necessary to refer to a few more facts as also to the pleadings to the parties Giving effect to the 1979 Rules, a fresh provisional seniority list of Assistant Engineers was prepared and communicated to the persons concerned. The revised provisional seniority list is referred hereinafter as 1979 provisional seniority list. It is on receipt of the said seniority list that the four petitioners herein have come forward with the present writ petition. The petitioners submit that the 1979 Rules are arbitrary, unreasonable and discriminatory and that they have been deliberately so framed as to prejudice the seniority position of the promotees. They submit that the 1972 provisional seniority list was correctly prepared in accordance with the decision of the Delhi High Court and that the 1979 Rules have been so designed as to undo the effect of the Judgment of this Court and Delhi High Court.By virtue of the 1979 seniority Rules, the promotees have been relegated to far lower positions in seniority as compared to their position obtaining in 1972 list. The direct recruits on the other hand have gained enormously vis-a-vis the 1972 list. By way of illustration, the petitioners have cited two instances: One is that of Sri R.M. Agrawal who is a direct recruit(temporary) vis-a-vis Shri A.N. Kapoor, a promotee. In the 1972 list their position was 1033 and 207 respectively whereas in the 1979 seniority list their position is 623 and 624 respectively. In other words, whereas a direct recruit (temporary) has come up from 1033 to 623, the promotee has gone down from 207 to 624. Another instance cited is that of Shri G.S. Mittal, direct recruit (temporary) vis-a-vis Shri S. Doraiswamy, promotee. In the 1972 list, their position was 1094 and 236 respectively which has become 691 and 692 respectively in the 1979 list. Inasmuch as this situation has been brought about by virtue of the 1979 Rules, the petitioners' main attach is directed against the said rules, particularly insofar as they provide that seniority of Assistant Engineers shall be determined with reference to and shall depend upon their date of confirmation. The petitioners say that seniority does not and should not be made to depend upon the date of confirmation. The reliefs sought for in the writ petition are (a) to strike down the 1979 rules (b) to quash the 1979 provisional seniority list and (c) to restore the 1972 provisional seniority list. It is evident that reliefs (b) and (c) are more or less consequential to relief (a). The main question before us is the validity of the 1979 rules and in particular the rule which predicates seniority on the date of confirmation. If the said rules are found to be good, question of quashing the 1979 provisional seniority list or restoring the 1972 provisional seniority list does not arise. Moreover, the impugned 1979 list is also a provisional list and yet to be finalised after considering the objections received in that behalf. We shall, therefore, have to confine our attention to the validity of the Rules, rather than the correctness of the provisional seniority list prepared on the basis of the Rules. In the counter-affidavit filed by one Shri Jagdish Prasad, Deputy Director (Administration) in the office of Director General (Works), C.P.W.D., New Delhi, it is submitted that though the 1972 provisional seniority list was prepared on the basis of the judgment of the Delhi High Court, the matter was thoroughly re-examined after the decision of this Court in Jagmal Singh and the 1979 Rules were issued after consulting the Law Department and keeping in view all the relevant facts and circumstances of the case. It is submitted that the judgment of this court aforesaid impliedly concedes the existence of a nexus between confirmation and seniority. The Rules are perfectly just and valid. The 1972 seniority list, it is submitted, was also a provisional one and before it could be finalised, the 1979 Rules were promulgated by the President of India, with retrospective effect from 1954, which Rules prescribed the mode of determining the seniority of Assistant Engineers. Accordingly, a new revised seniority list was prepared. It is submitted in para 20 \"that the appointees under Rule 3(b) have been selected for appointment by the same Departmental Promotion Committee which have considered the question of promotion of officers as Assistant Engineers under Rule 3(c). By clubbing them together the persons appointed under Rule 3(b) are not at a disadvantageous position. Direct recruits who have come against permanent posts are a distinct group.\" It is also submitted that \"both the temporary appointments under Rule 3(a) and promotees under Rule 3(b) and (c) have been treated alike in the Rules by giving them 1:1 ratio.\" Another relevant statement made in the counter-affidavit is that \"the cadre consists of both permanent and temporary officers.\" It is submitted that the persons appointed against the permanent posts have a prior claim for confirmation over those appointed against temporary posts. It was brought to our notice that after the filing of the writ petition, the 1979 Rules have been extensively amended in the year 1982 with retrospective effect from 21st May, 1954 and another fresh provisional seniority list has been prepared and communicated on basis of the 1979 Rules as amended 1982. For a full and complete disposal of the dispute, we thought it necessary to take notice of the 1982 Amendments and the revised provisional seniority list prepared on that basis. Actually these amendments were brought to our notice only in the written submissions, which were filed after the close of arguments. In this view of the matter, we directed the matter to be posted for further hearing, on which occasion, the counsel for petitioners brought to our notice not only the 1982 Amendments but also the 1976 and 1978 Amendments referred to hereinbefore. We have taken notice of all these Amendments in the interest of justice and with a view to do effective justice between the parties. (The only respondents to the writ petition are the Union of India, Director General of Works and U.P.S.C. No other group or any of its members are impleaded). The reason for promulgating the 1982 Amendments is stated in the explanatory Memorandum accompanying the Amendments. It reads: \"In the Central Public Works Department, Assistant Engineers (Central Engineering Service) Group `B' (Confirmation and Seniority) Rules, 1979, which had been given retrospective effect from the 21st May, 1954, the definitions of Assistant Engineers appointed by different methods had not been given. This amendment has necessarily to be given retrospective effect from the same date as the original rules. In the Civil Appeal number 1260 of 1973 - Shri Jagmal Singh Yadav v, Ramayyah & Others - the Superme Court had also observed that there was no impediment in the way of the Government to make appropriate rules regarding conditions of service, even retrospectively subject to constitutionality and keeping in view justice and fair play to all concerned. 2. The Central Engineering Service Class II Recruitment Rules and the Central Electrical Engineering Service Class II, Recruitment Rules, do not contain the principles for determinating the seniority of officers appointed to the grade of Assistant Engineers through different methods except Direct Recruitment. No special orders were also issued by Government in the past laying down any such principles. Therefore, the officers appointed to these services are deemed to be governed by the general principles of seniority issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs in their office memorandum number 30/44/48-Apptt. dated the 22nd June, 1949 and number 9/11/55-RPS dated the 22nd December, 1959 respectively, according as to whether they were appointed to the service prior to the 22nd December, 1959 or on or after that date. The present amendment seeks to incorporate these principles, to the extent possible and practicable, in the Central Public Works Department, Assistant Engineers (Central Engineering Service and Central Electrical Engineering (Central Engineering Service and Central Electrical Engineering Service) Group `B' (Confirmation and Seniority) Rules, 1979, since the principles have to be applied for deter- mining the seniority of officers appointed to the service in the past also, these have necessarily to be given retrospective effect from the date of the Constitution of the service, viz., the 21st May, 1954. The proposed amendment, according to Government will be equitable, fair and just to all groups of Assistant Engineers in the Central Public Works Department.\" The 1982 Amendments have not only substituted Rules 4 & 5 but also added certain definitions in Rule 2(1). Further, for the reasons set out in the Explanatory Memorandum, a cut-off date - if it can be so described for the sake of convenience - is prescribed. It is 22nd December, 1959. Appointments made prior to this date and those made after this date are dealt with on different footing. After the substitution of Rules 4 and 5, Rule 4 deals with seniority while Rule 5 deals with confirmations, whereas before the 1982 Amendments, Rule 4 dealt with confirmation and Rule 5 with seniority. The definitions introduced in Rule 2(1) which are relevant for the present purposes - read as follows: \"(c) Assistant Engineers recruited against permanent posts\" means those Assistant Engineers who have been directly recruited through the Union Public Service Commission against permanent posts of Assistant Engineers in accordance with clause (a) of rule 3 read with Part III of the Service Rules; (d) \"Assistant Engineers recruited against temporary posts\" means those Assistant Engineers who have been directly recruited through the Union Public Service Commission against temporary posts of Assistant Engineers in the Central Public Works Department in accordance with clause (a) of rule 3 read with Part III of the Service Rules; (e) \"Assistant Engineers promoted from the lower ranks\" means those Assistant Engineers whether graduates or Diploma holders; promoted or selected from the rank of Section Officers to the grade of Assistant Engineers by a duly constituted Departmental Promotion Committee in accordance with either clause (b) or rule 3 read with Part IV or clause (c) of rule 3 read with Part V of the Service Rules as they existed before they were amended by GSR numbers 418 and 419 dated the 8th March, 1978.\" Rule 4 and 5 as substituted in 1982 read thus: \"4. Seniority (i) Notwithstanding anything else contained in the Service Rules, the seniority of the members of the service appointed by whichever method, or before the 21st December, 1959 shall be determined with reference to the date of their appointment as Assistant Engineers, irrespective of whatever they have been confirmed in the grade or not and they shall rank en bloc senior to those appointed on or after the 22nd December, 1959. Note: For the purpose of this sub-rule, the date of appointment of the direct recruits of any batch appointed on or after the 21st May, 1954 shall be deemed to be earliest date on which any person from that batch joined in the service. (2) Subject to the provisions of sub-rule (4), the seniority of the members of the service appointed by whichever method, on or after the 22nd December, 1959 shall be determined in the order of their confirmation under Rule 5: Provided that their inter se seniority shall be determined by the order of merit in which they are selected for such appointment: Provided further that persons appointed as a result of earlier selection shall rank senior to those appointed as a result of subsequent selection. (3) As from the commencement of the Central Engineering Service, Class II, Recruitment (Amendment) Rules, 1976 and the Central Electrical Engineering Service, Class II, Recruitment (Amendment) Rules, 1976, the relative seniority of promotee Assistant Engineers under clause (i) and (ii) of rule 24 of the Service Rules shall be regulated according to the rotation of vacancies based on the quotas prescribed for such promotions beginning with a promotee under clause (i) of the said rule. (4) The relative seniority of the members of the service appointed, by whichever method, shall follow the following order. Persons falling in each later category shall rank junior to persons falling in the earlier category: (i) Assistant Engineers appointed by whichever method on or before the 21st day of December, 1959; (ii) Assistant Engineers appointed on or after the 22nd day of December, 1959, against the permanent vacancies, in any particular post, in accordance with Part III of the Service Rules, and confirmed in accordance with sub-clause (ii) of clause (b) of rule 5 in that year. (iii) Assistant Engineers appointed on or after the 22nd day of December, 1959 and confirmed in any particular year after the confirmation of the Assistant Engineers referred to in clause (ii) of this sub-rule, in the manner and in the order specified in sub-clause (iii) of clause (b) of sub- rule (2) of rule 5, in that year. Confirmation: (1) To be eligible to be considered for confirmation an Assistant Engineer appointed, by whichever method, shall have; (a) completed the period of probation satisfactorily and (b) passed such tests as may be prescribed from time to time by government by general or special orders. (2) Notwithstanding anything else contained in the Service Rules, but subject to the provisions of sub-clause (1) above, the confirmation of Assistant Engineers in the service shall be regulated in accordance with the provisions hereinafter contained, namely:- (a) The Assistant Engineers appointed by whichever method, on or before the 21st day of December, 1959 but not confirmed before that date shall be confirmed in the order of their seniority, subject to their being found fit under sub-rule (1). (b) Confirmation, in the grade of Assistant Engineers who were appointed on or after the 22nd December, 1959 shall be made in the following manner, namely:- (i) the number of permanent vacancies available in each year shall be determined in the first instance. (ii) Assistant Engineers recruited against permanent posts in a particular year, who have completed the period of probation, shall be confirmed en bloc against permanent vacancies available in that year, in order of the inter se seniority of such officers and, where the number of Assistant Engineers so appointed in a particular year exceeds the number of permanent posts available in that year, such Assistant Engineers shall be confirmed against supernumeratory posts which shall be created for that purpose. (iii) After the Assistant Engineers of the category mentioned in sub-clause (ii) have been confirmed in a year, the Assistant Engineers recruited against temporary posts and the Assistant Engineers promoted from lower ranks on temporary basis, who have completed the period of probation, shall be confirmed subject to their being otherwise found fit, against permanent vacancies available in that year by continuous interspersing of one promotee and one direct recruit appointed against temporary post till the permanent vacancies of that year are exhausted. Provided that if, in a particular year, any of the categories mentioned in sub-clause (iii) nemely, the promotees or the direct recruits against temporary posts, gets exhausted in following the procedure set out in this sub-clause, the remaining permanent vacancies shall en bloc go to the group having unconfirmed Assistant Engineers: Provided further that if, in a particular year, the number of permanent vacancies is less than the number of Assistant Engineers in the categories mentioned in sub-clause (iii), the Assistant Engineers not confirmed in that year shall be con- sidered for confirmation against permanent vacancies of the subsequent year, by again following the principle of inter-spersing, after the direct recruits against permanent posts of that year have first been adjusted in the manner indicated in sub-clause (ii). The direct recruits or, as the case may be, the promotees shall be selected for such confirmation under this clause in the order of their seniority in their respective seniority lists.\" It is necessary to notice the effect of the 1982 amendments. As would be evident from the definitions \"Assistant Engineers recruited against permanent posts\", are those appointed under Rule 3(a) of the 1954 Rules against permanent vacancies, while \"Assistant Engineers recruited against temporary posts\" means those appointed under Rule 3(a) against temporary posts. \"Assistant Engineers promoted from the lower ranks\", are those appointed/promoted under unamended clauses (b) and (c) of Rule 3. More important, seniority now depends upon the date of confirmation, which is determined in accordance with Rule 5 of 1979/1982 Rules. If we read Rule 5 closely, it becomes clear that of the permanent vacancies available in a year, the direct recruits against permanent vacancies are to be accommadated en bloc in the first instance. And thereafter if any vacancies are left, the direct recruits against temporary posts and promotees (which category now includes Assistant Engineers recruited and promoted under Clauses (b) and (c) - unamended - of Rule 3 of the 1954 Rules) are to be accommodately alternately. This process is to be repeated each year. Then again, while Rule 5 refers to \"Assistant Engineers recruited against permanent posts\" and \"Assistant Engineers recruited against temporary posts\", it does not speak of \"Assistant Engineers promoted from lower ranks\". It speaks of \"Assistant Engineers promoted from lower ranks on temporary basis\". What does this mean? Does it mean that all promotee engineers (including those `direct recruits' appointed under unamended clause (b) of Rule 3) were appointed/promoted only against temporary posts ? Was no such person appointed or promoted against a permanent post? Were all permanent posts meant only for direct recruits? Rules do not say so, nor does the counter affidavit assert so. (If this were so, the seniority list prepared in 1972 would not have been prepared in the manner it was prepared.) If on the other hand, these persons were also appointed and promoted against some of the permanent vacancies, then where do they fit in in the sequence prescribed by Rule 5? There is no explanation, nor any appartent reason, why the direct recruits against permanent posts are treated as a superior category to all the promotees en bloc. Not a single promotee - not even an Assistant Engineer recruited under unamended clause (b) of Rule 3 of the 1954 Rules - is ranked on par with them. They are placed on par with Assistant recruited against temporary posts. This is totally at variance with the basis and principle upon which the 1972 seniority list was prepared pursuant to the Judgment of Delhi High Court - which was later affirmed by this Court. There is yet another glaring feature. So far as the appointments/promotions made prior to December 22, 1959 are concerned, they are to be confirmed in the order of their appointment - which means that seniority is determined on the basis of their appointment irrespective of the mode in which he is appointed. But when it comes to the period subsequent to December 22, 1959, the rule is altogether different. The Assistant Engineers appointed/promoted on or after December 22, 1959 are divided into three categories mentioned above. There is no reason or basis for the date 22.12.1959 except that it is the date on which the subsequent Memorandum of the Home Ministry (said to contain the principles regarding determination of seniority) was issued. (We have not been shown a copy of the said Memorandum.) It is not a mere case of different principle being adopted subsequent to 22.12.1959, it is inherent vice of discrimination implicit in it that is hurting the promotees (as defined in amended Rule 3(b) of the 1954 Rules). The petitioners say that on the basis of the 1982 amendments, a fresh revised provisional seniority list has been prepared and communicated to all concerned, inviting their objections, if any. They say that in this revised list they have been further sent down to far lower positions than in the 1979 list. The respondents, on the hand, submit that the amendments are perfectly just and equitable and that no legitimate grievance can be made against the Rules or the revised provisional seniority list of 1982. Now it is true that Rules made under the Proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution being legislative in character cannot be struck down merely because the Court thinks that they are unreasonable, - and that they can be struck down only on the grounds upon which a legislative measure can be struck down. (Vide B.S. Vadera v. Union of India, (1969) S.C. 118 and B.S. Yadav v. State of Haryana, (1981) S.C. 561, we are yet of the opinion that Rule 4 of 1979 Rules (as amended in 1982) in so far as it predicates seniority on the date of confirmation - which confirmation is directed to be made on a wholly unequal and discriminatory basis - is violative of the equal opportunity clause enshrined in Article 16 of the Constitution. The cadre, it is admitted consists of both permanent and temporary members. The Rules do not say that promotees shall not be appointed against permanent posts or that they shall be appointed only against temporary posts. It is true that generally direct recruitment is made only against permanent vacancies/posts whereas promotions may be made both against permanent as well as temporary vacancies/posts. But in this service, it is clear from the Rules themselves that even the direct recruitment is made against temporary posts. In short, there is no distinction between the four erstwhile categories mentioned in unamended Rule 3.They could be appointed both against permanent as well as temporary posts. If so, there appears to be no justification for treating all the appointees under clauses (b) and (c) of Rule 3, en bloc, on par with direct recruits against temporary posts (as has been done by Rules 4 and 5 of 1979/1982 Rules) which suggests as if all such appointments were made, at all points of time, only against temporary posts. At the cost of repetition, we may mention that those appointed under unamended clause (b) or Rule 3 were expressly referred to as direct appointees and yet they are now converted into promotees en bloc and downgraded vis- a-vis direct recruits under unamended clause (a) of Rule 3. All this, in our opinion, is discriminatory and violative of Articles 14 and 16(1). There were four channels/sources of appointment. Direct recruitment was one of them - unamended clause (a). Unamended clause (b) provided for another type of direct appointment while unamended clause (c) provided for promotion. True, there was no quota fixed as between them as held by this Court and Delhi High Court but the Rules nowhere stated that appointment under unamended clauses (b) and (c) shall be made only against temporary posts. All the four sources were equal - quality-wise. Neither was superior to the other. In these circumstances, bringing in new concepts of \"Assistant Engineers recruited against permanent posts\", and \"Assistant Engineers promoted from the lower ranks\" through the 1979 Rules (as amended by 1982 Rules) and treating the latter category unfavourably on that basis (vide Rules 4 and 5 of 1979/1982 Rules) is a clear case of hostile discrimination. In this context, if we recall the principles enunciated by the Delhi High Court and this court in the earlier writ petition referred to hereinbefore, the intention of the Rule-making authority to undo the effect of the said Judgments, to the grave prejudice of the Assistant Engineers appointed under clauses (b) and (c) of unamended Rule 3 becomes crystal clear. The entire course of amendments and new Rules appears to be designed to undo the effect of the said Judgment with retrospective effect. Not only the classification has no basis in the Rules - or in the factual situation - it is unreasonable and unjust; it is also unrelated to the object - the object being efficiency of administration. In S.B. Patwardhan and ANR v. State of Maharashtra and ORS A.I.R. 1977 S.C. 2051, this court observed:- \"Instead of adopting an intelligible diffentia, Rule 8(iii) leaves seniority to be determined on the sole touchstone of confirmation which seems to us indefensible. Confirmation is one of the inglorious uncertainties of Government service depending neither on efficiency of the incumbent nor on the availability of substantive vacancies. A glaring instance widely known in a part of our country is of a distinguished member of the judiciary who was confirmed as a District Judge years after he was confirmed as a Judge of the High Court. It is on the record of these writ petitions that officiating Deputy Engineers were not confirmed even though substantive vacancies were available in which they could have been confirmed. It shows that confirmation does not have to conform to any set rules and whether an employee should be confirmed or not depends on the sweet will and pleasure of the Government. Rule 8(ii) in the instant case adopts the seniority-cum-merit test for preparing the statewise Select List of seniority. And yet Clause (III) rejects the test of merit altogether. The vice of that clause is that it leaves the valuable right of seniority to depend upon the mere accident of confirmation. That, under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution, is impermissible and therefore we must strike down Rule 8(iii) as being unconstitutional.\" The petitioners also rely upon the following observations from the same judgment: \"Though drawn from two different sources, the direct recruits and promotees constitute in the instant case a single integrated cadre. They discharge identical functions, bear similar responsibilities and acquire an equal amount of experience in their respective assignments. And yet clause (iii) of Rule 8 provides that probationers recruited during any year shall in a bunch be treated as senior to promotees confirmed in that year. The plain arithmetic of this formula is that a direct recruit appointed on probation, say in 1966, is to be regarded as senior to a promotee who was appointed as an officiating Deputy Engineer, say in 1956, but was confirmed in 1966 after continuous officiation till then.\" True it is that in the present case, a formula contained in Rule 5 of 1979 Rules (as amended in 1982) is devised to govern the order of confirmation, but as demonstrated above, this very rule is discriminatory inasmuch as it seeks to treat equals unequally, to the prejudice of what is now compendiously called, the class of \"promotees\". For the above reasons, it must be held that Rule 4 of the Central Public Works Department Assistant Engineers (Central Engineering Service and Central Electrical Engineering Service) Group `B' (Confirmation and Seniority) Rules, 1979 (as amended by the Central Public Works Department, Assistant Engineers (Central Engineering Service and Central Electrical Engineering Service) Group `B' (confirmation and Seniority) Amendment Rules, 1982), insofar as it predicates the seniority of Assistant Engineers (appointed on or after December 22, 1959) on the date of their confirmation, is violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed to the petitioners (and other similarly placed Assistant Engineers) by Articles 14 and 16(1) of the Constitution of India and accordingly held to be inoperative and void. Having regard to the period for which this dispute has been pending and in the facts and circumstances of this case and for the reasons recorded hereinbefore, we direct that the seniority of Assistant Engineers appointed on or after December 22, 1959 shall be determined on the same basis and in the same manner as it is determined in the case of Assistant Engineers appointed prior to the said date. This direction is made keeping in view the desirability of giving a quietus to this dispute at least now. The writ petition is, accordingly, allowed in the above terms. No order as to costs. T.N.A.

Appeal from the judgment and order dated November 18, 1958, of the Bombay High Court at Nagpur in Special Civil Application number 201 of 1958. N. C. Chatterjee, M. N. Phadke, S. A. Sonhi and Ganpat Rai, for the appellants. A. V. Viswanatha Sastri, B. R. Mandekar and A. G. Ratnaparkhi, for respondent number 1. G. C. Mathur and R. H. Dhebar, for respondent number 2. 1961. January 27. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR., J.-This is an appeal against the jugdment and order of the High Court of Judicature of Bombay at Nagpur dismissing a petition under articles 226 & 227 of the Constitution challenging the legality of the imposition of the octroi tax under section 66(1)(e) of the C. P. & Berar Municipal Act (Act II of 1922) hereinafter termed the Act. The appellants who were the petitioners in the High Court are some of the rate-payers of the town of Akola in the erstwhile State of Bombay and respondent number 1 is the Municipal Committee, Akola. On November 11, 1957, respondent number 1 passed a resolution to impose an octroi tax on animals and goods brought within the limits of the Akola Municipality. This resolution and the draft Rules of Assessment and Collection were later on forwarded by the Akola Municipality to the State Government for publication. A notification dated January 3, 1958, was published in the Bombay Government Gazette on January 16, 1958. This Gazette Notification contained the draft rules, the schedule of goods liable to octroi duty and the rates to be charged. This was in accordance with the requirements of section 67(2) of the Act. Respondentnumber 1, the Municipal Committee, affixed on the Notice Board of the Committee and published in the local newspapers the proposed rules for the imposition of the tax, but the objection of the appellants is that they did not publish along with them the draft of the \" System of Assessment \". It is true that a pamphlet in Marathi language was distributed in the town of Akola and the proposals were also published in the local newspaper Jan-Sewak. Objections to the proposals were filed by some of the rate-payers of the town of Akola and all of them were considered and a resolution was passed by the Municipal Committee on March 3, 1958, and that is the resolution which was challenged in the petition filed in the High Court by a petition dated April 14, 1958, p raying for the quashing of the resolution and for the issuing of a prohibitory order against the State Government against sanctioning the proposal sent by the Municipal Committee. On April 18, 1958, a rule was issued by the High Court to the opposite parties calling upon them to show cause why the, order as prayed should not be made. This notice was served on the Special Government Pleader on May 9, 1958, and the Special Government Pleader put in his appearance on June 17, 1958. On June 23, 1958, an interim injunction was issued, but previous to that on June 19, 1958, a final notification was issued by the Government approving of the proposal to impose the octroi tax. As a consequence of this the petition was allowed to be amended, but ultimately the High Court dismissed the petition and this appeal has been brought on a certificate of the High Court. The sole question which has been debated before us is the legality of the imposition. The ground on which the legality is challenged is that there was no full compliance with the mandatory requirements of section 67(2) of the Act. It is, therefore, necessary to deal with the relevant provisions of the Act. Chapter IX of the Act deals with Imposition, Assessment and Collection of taxes. Section 66 provides for the taxes which can be imposed and section 67 deals with the mode of the imposition of the tax. By section 71, the StateGovernment is empowered to make rules regulating the assessment of taxes and for preventing evasion of assessment. Section 76 empowers the State Government to make rules regulating the collection of taxes and preventing evasion of payment. Section 85 em- Con powers the State Government to make rules regulating the refund of taxes. But it was argued on behalf of the appellants that as the mandatory provisions of section 67 as to publication of the \" System of Assessment \" in accordance with the rules was not complied with, the imposition of the tax was illegal. Reliance was placed on certain judgments, but it is not necessary to discuss those cases because in the circumstances of this case they are of little assistance. The respondents, on the other hand, submitted that what was published was all that the section required and that the word assessment there did not mean anything more. As section 67(2) has been mainly relied upon, it may be quoted. It provides:- \" 67(2) When such a resolution has been passed, the committee shall publish in accordance with rules made under this Act, a 'notice defining the class of persons or description of property proposed to be taxed, the amount or rate of the tax to be imposed and the system of assessment to be adopted.\" The scheme of section 67 appears to be this: that when a Municipal Committee wishes to impose a tax it has to pass a resolution at a special meeting and then it has to publish its resolution for imposition of that tax so that the rate- payers may be able to place their objections against the imposition. This publication must appear in the Government Gazette and also locally as required by the rules. The Municipal Committee has then to consider the objections, if any, of the rate-payers and if the Committee does not consider it necessary to alter its original proposals, it has to send its proposals with the objections received and its decision thereon and any modifications of the original proposals to the State Government which, after considering the matter, may sanction them or refuse to sanction or sanction them with modifications,The real objection of the appellants was that the system of assessment had not seen published as required. The Rule relating to publication under section 67 is as follows :- \" 1. A notice under section 67(2) of the intention of the municipal committee to impose a tax, or under section 68(3) of the proposal of the committee to increase the amount of rate of any tax, shall be forwarded to the State Government through the Deputy Commissioner for publication in the \" Madhya Pradesh Gazette. \" The notice under section 67(2)shall be accompanied by draft rules for the assessment and collection of the tax. After its publication in the Gazette the, notice shall be published by affixing copies thereof to a notice board at the municipal office and at conspicuous places in the town, and shall also be published in the local papers, if any. As an alternative to its publication in local papers, the committee may circulate the notice in print in vernacular within the municipal limits. Proclamation shall also be made by beat of drum throughout the municipality notifying the intention of the committee and calling the attention of the inhabitants to the notice in question and to the term of thirty days laid down in the law as that within which objections to the proposed imposition or increase must be submitted to the committee.\" According to this rule the notice under section 67(2) has to be accompanied by draft rules for the assessment and collection of the tax and after its publication in the Gazette the notice has to be published by affixing copies thereof to a notice board at the Municipal Office and at conspicuous places in the town and has to be published in the local papers, if any, or it may circulate the notice in print within the municipal limits. It is admitted that in the Gazette dated January 16, 1958, the draft rules were published which contained the articles to be taxed, the rate or rates at which they were to be taxed and what articles were not to be taxed. It also contained a brief statement of objects. and reasons for the imposition of the tax. This wasfollowed by draft rules as to how taxation was to be done. In short what was published in the Gazette was admitted to conform to all the requirements of section 67(2). But the contention raised is that in the Jan-Sewak, a local Marathi newspaper, the rules which were published contained the articles to be taxed, the rate or rates at which they were to be taxed, but the draft rules in regard to \" System of Assessment \" were not published along with it. The High Court has pointed out that what was done was a sufficient compliance with the provisions of section 67(2) and that the words \" System of Assessment \" meant only the stage of the imposition of the tax and not other stages as a whole. Sections 71, 76 and 85, as has been said above, deal with rules for assessment and for preventing evasion of taxes, rules for collection of taxes and rules for refund respectively. Read together these provisions of the Act support the decision of the High Court that the words \" System of Assessment \" do not necessarily mean the whole procedure of taxation, i.e., imposition, collection and procedure in regard to collection and refunds. The rule also shows that what is to be affixed on the notice board and at conspicuous places of the town is the notice and not the draft rules relating to assessment and collection. In our opinion there has been a compliance with the provision of section 67(2) and that the publication of the rules relating to the rates at which the tax had been imposed was sufficient to comply with the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder. It is unnecessary to deal with the efficacy of sub-ss. (7) and (8) of section 67. In our opinion the judgment of the High Court was right and the appeal is therefore dismissed with costs.

If any information disclosing a cognizable offence is laid before an officer-in-charge of a police station satisfying the requirements of Section 154(1) of the Crimi- nal Procedure Code, the said police officer has no other option except to enter the substance thereof in the pre- scribed form, that is to say, to register a case on the basis of such information. [279G] 3.2. Though a police officer cannot investigate a non- \u00ef7offence, he can investigate a non-cognizable offence under the order of a Magistrate having power to try such non- cognizable case or commit the same for trial within the terms under Section 155(2) of the Code but subject to Sec- tion 155(3) of the Code. Further, under the newly introduced Sub-section (4) to Section 155, where a case relates to two offences to which atleast one is cognizable, the case shall be deemed to be a cognizable case notwithstanding that the other offences are non-cognizable and, therefore, under such circumstances the police officers can investigate such offences with the same powers as he has while investigating a cognizable offence. [279H; 280A-B] 4. The core of the Sections 156, 157 and 159 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is that if a police officer has reason to suspect the commission of a cognizable offence, he must either proceed with the investigation or cause an investiga- tion to be proceeded with by his subordinate; that in a case where the police officer sees no sufficient ground for investigation, he can dispense with the investigation alto- gether; that the field of investigation of any cognizable offence is exclusively within the domain of the investiga- tion agencies over which the Courts cannot havecontrol and have no power to stiffle or impinge upon the proceedings in the investigation so long as the investiga- tion proceeds in compliance with the provisions relating to investigation and that it is only in a case wherein a police officer decides not to investigate an offence, the concerned Magistrate can intervene and either direct an investigation or in the alternative, if he thinks fit, he himself can, at once proceed or depute any Magistrate sub-ordinate to him to proceed to hold a preliminary inquiry into or otherwise to dispose of the case in the manner provided in the Code.

Khwaja Nazir Ahmad, AIR 1954 P.C. 18 and Abhinandan v. Dinesh, [1967] 3 SCR 668; referred to. 5.1. The expression \"reason to suspect the commission of an offence\" used in Section 154(1) Criminal . P.C. would mean the sagacity of rationally inferring the commission of a cogniz- able offence based on the specific articulate facts men- tioned in the First Information Report as well in the Annex- ures, if any, enclosed and any attending circumstances which may not amount to proof. In other words, the meaning of the expression \"reason to suspect\" has to be governed and dic- tated by the facts and circumstances of each case and at \u00ef7in the First Information Report does not arise. [286E-F] 5.2. The commencement of investigation by a police officer is subject to two conditions, firstly, the police officer should have reason to suspect the commission of a cognizable offence as required by Section 157(1) and second- ly, the police officer should subjectively satisfy himself as to whether there is sufficient ground for entering on an investigation even before he starts an investigation into the facts and circumstances of the case as contemplated under clause (b) of the proviso to Section 157(1) of the Code.

The investigation of an offence is the field exclu- sively reserved for the police officers whose powers in that field are unfettered so long as the power to investigate into the cognizable offences is legitimately exercised in strict compliance with the provisions falling under Chapter XII of the Code and the Courts are not justified in obliter- ating the track of investigation when the investigating agencies are well within their legal bounds. A noticeable feature of the scheme under Chapter XIV of the Code is that a Magistrate is kept in the picture at all stages of the police investigation but he is not authorised to interfere with the actual investigation or to direct the police how that investigation is to be conducted. But if a police officer transgresses the circumscribed limits and improperly and illegally exercises his investigatory powers in breach of any statutory provision causing serious prejudice to the personal liberty and also property of a citizen, then the Court, on being approached by the person aggrieved for the redress of any grievance has to consider the nature and extent of the breach and pass appropriate orders as may be called for without leaving the citizens to the mercy of police echelons since human dignity is a dear value of our Constitution. No one can demand absolute immunity even if he is wrong and claim unquestionable right and unlimited powers exercisable upto unfathomable cosmos. Any recognition of \u00ef7Power' which no authority on earth can enjoy. [290D-G] Emperor v. Khwaja Nazir Ahmad, AIR 1945 P.C. 18; R.P. Kapur v.

[293D] 7.2. It is true that some of the allegations do suffer from mistyvagueness and lack of particulars. Further, there are no specific averments that either Respondent number 1 or his relations and friends had no source of income to accumulate the properties now standing in their names and that Respond- ent number 1 showed any favour to them by misusing his official position. [294B-C] These are all matters which would be examined only during the course of investigation and thereafter by the court on the material collected and placed before it by the investigating agencies. The question whether the relations and friends of Respondent number 1 have independently purchased the properties out of their own funds or not, also cannot be decided by the Court at this stage on the denial statement of Respondent number 1 alone.

In the exercise of the extra-ordinary power under Article 226 or the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the following categories of cases are given by way of illustration wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible guide- \u00ef7myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should be exer- cised: (a) where the allegations made in the First Information Report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the ac- cused; (b) where the allegations in the First Information Report and other materials, if any, accompanying the F.I.R. do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investi- gation by police officers under Section 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code; (c) where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or 'complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do not disclosethe commission of any offence and make out a case against the accused; (d) where the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code; (e) where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused; (f) where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institu- tion and continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in the Code or the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party; (g) where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge. [305D-H; 306A-E] 8.2. In the instant case, the allegations made in the complaint, do clearly constitute a cognizable offence justi- \u00ef7on and this case does not call for the exercise of extraor- dinary or inherent powers of the High Court to quash the F.I.R. itself.

The entire matter is only at a premature stage and the investigation has not proceeded with except some prelim- inary effort taken on the date of the registration of the case. The evidence has to be gathered after a thorough investigation and placed before the Court on the basis of which alone the Court can come to a conclusion one way or the other on the plea of mala fides. If the allegations are bereft of truth and made maliciously, the investigation will say so. At this stage, when there are only allegations and recriminations but no evidence, this Court cannot anticipate the result of the investigation and render a finding on the question of mala fides on the materials at present avail-. able. Therefore, it cannot be said that the complaint should be thrown overboard on the mere unsubstantiated plea of mala fides. Even assuming that the complainant has laid the complaint only on account of his personal animosity that, by itself, will not be a ground to discard the complaint con- taining serious allegations which have to be tested and weighed after the evidence is collected. [307G-H; 308A-D] \u00ef73 9.2. The dominant purpose of registration of the case and the intended follow up action are only to investigate the allegations and present a case before the Court, if sufficient evidence in support of those allegations are collected but not to make a character assassination of the person complained against.

A police officer with whom an investigation of an offenceunder Section 5(1)(e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act is entrusted should not proceed with a pre-conceived idea of guilt of that person indicated with such offence and subject him to any harassment and victimisation, because in case the allegations of illegal accumulation of wealth are found, during the course of investigation as baseless, the harm done not only to that person but also to the office he held will be incalculable and inestimable. [297C-E] 10.2. In the instant case, the SP seems to have exhibit- ed some over-enthusiasm, presumably to please 'some one' and had directed the SHO to register the case and investigate the same even on the very first day of the receipt of the complaint from the DGP, in whose office the complaint was lying for merely 9 days. This unprecedented overenthusiasm shown by the S.P., without disclosing the reasons for making an order entrusting the investigation to the SHO who is not a designated officer under Section 5A(1), really shocks ones' sense of justice and fair play even though the untest- ed allegations made in the complaint require a thorough investigation. Still, it is an inexplicable riddle as to why the S.P. had departed from the normal rule and hastly or- dered the SHO to investigate the serious allegations, le- velled against a former Chief Minister and a Minister in the Cabinet of the Central Government on the face of the regis- tration of the case. However, this conduct of the SP can never serve as a ground for quashing the FIR. [298C-E] Sirajuddin v. State of Madras, [1970] 3 SCR 931; The State of Uttar Pradesh v.

A police officer not below the rank of an Inspec- tor of Police authorised by the State Government in terms of the First proviso can take up the investigation of an of- fence referred to in clause (e) of Section 5(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, only on a separate and inde- pendent order of a police officer not below the rank of a Superintendent of Police. A strict compliance of the second proviso is an additional legal requirement to that of the first proviso for conferring a valid authority on a police officer not below the rank of an Inspector of Police to investigate an offence falling under clause (e) of Section 5(1) of the Act.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by K.N. SAIKIA. J. This analogous cluster of seventeen appeals by special leave, and a special leave petition involves a common question of law though they arise out of the following respective facts: c.A. numbers 324 z-3248 of 1981 These eight appeals by the Land Development and Reclama- tion Corporation, Chandigarh are from the Judgment and Order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court dismissing its writ petitions challenging the Award dated 2.8.1980 of the Labour Court, Chandigarh holding that the respondents were entitled to reinstatement with back wages except Yaspal (C.A. number 3242 of 1981) who was to get wages up to 10.10.1979, with benefits of continuity of service. The respondents were workmen under the management of the Corporation and their services were terminated on the ground that the Chairman had no power to appoint them. The Labour Court in its Award held that their services were terminated illegally without pay- ment of retrenchment compensation under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, hereinafter referred to as the Act', and that they were entitled to reinstatement.C.A. number 686 (NL) of 1982 This appeal is from the Judgment dated 9.11.1981 of the High Court of Bombay (Nagpur Bench). The first respondent was an employee of the appellant's corporation since 1972. He was taken on probation in 1975 for one year which was extended from time to time, lastly from 1.9.1977 to 31.10. 1977, whereafter his services being not found satisfactory were terminated with effect from 1.11.1977 under Regulation 44(b) of the State Transport Employees Service Regulations of the Corporation. The Labour Court took the view that it amounted to retrenchment and the provisions of section 25F of the Act having not been complied with the termination was ille- gal. The appellant's writ petition therefrom was dismissed. C.A. number 1817 of 1982 The respondent workman was employed by the appellant Bank on 3.10.1962 as a clerk and he was put on probation for six months. As allegedly there was total lack of confidence of the bank in the employee it terminated his service on 27.7.1974 on payment of three month's salary. The industrial tribunal by its award dated 3.12.1981 directed reinstatement of the workman with full back wages on the ground of non- compliance with the provisions of section 25F of the Industrial Disputes Act. The employer Bank now appeals from that Award. C.A. number 1898 of 1982 Respondent numbers 2-6 were employed on probation by the appellant a partnership firm on 12.6.1975. Respondent numbers 2-5 assaulted a supervisor and being afraid of police re- mained absent from 29.3.1976 and abandoned their jobs and their services were terminated. Respondent number 6 stopped attending duties from 9.8.1975 and he left the service of his own accord. The Labour Court by its Award dated 16.9. 1980 held that their termination amounted to retrenchment and was illegal for non-compliance with the provisions of s. 25F of the Act and they were entitled to reinstatement with full back wages. The Management's writ petition challenging the Award having been unsuccessful, it has appealed. C.A. number 3261 of 1982 Respondent Namdeo was a clerk under the appellant Maha- rashtra State Road Transport Corporation. Pursuant to a disciplinaryproceeding his service was terminated with effect from 23.4.1963 by giving him one month's salary in lieu of no- tice. Moved by the respondent, the Assistant Commissioner under section 16 of the C.P. & Berar Industrial Disputes Settle- ment Act, 1947 held the Inquiry Proceeding to be an empty paper formality and the termination amounted to dismissal and accordingly he set aside the order and directed the corporation to reinstate and pay him his back wages amount- ing to Rupees 15,97 1.66 within one month. The Corporation having moved the State Industrial Court at Nagpur under s. 16(5) of the Settlement Act, that Court by its order dated 29.9.1973 allowed the application and set aside the Assist- ant Labour Commissioner's judgment and dismissed the work- man's application holding that the acts of misconduct fairly stood proved and he deserved to be dismissed from service. The High Court on being moved by the workman set aside the Labour Court's order and restored that of the Assistant Labour Commissioner. Hence this appeal. CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3025 .......... OF 1990 The services of the workman Sri Pratap Singh, driver respondent number 3 were terminated with effect from 18.10.1974 under clause 9(a)(i) of the DRTA (Conditions of Appointment and Service) Regulations 1952. As the conciliation efforts failed, the order was placed before the Labour Court, Delhi, who set aside the order on the ground of noncompliance with the provisions of section 25F of the Act and ordered reinstate- ment with full back wages and continuity of service. The High Court having dismissed the writ petition therefrom, the appellant seeks special leave. We grant special leave and hear the appeal. C.A. number 885 of 1980 The workmen appellants numbers 2 and 3 were discharged on I 1.11.1972 for their trade union activities. The Labour Court, Bombay by its Award dated 25.8.1977 refused to inter- fere. Challenge to the Award in the High Court having failed, the workmen appealed to this Court. C.A. number 1866 of 1982 The workman respondent number 2 reported for artisan train- ing on 25.9.1963 and was absorbed as artisan trainee on 16.3.1964. He was made a skilled machine operator, under the appellant company and was discharged with effect from 23.7.1970. The Labour Court by itsAward dated 1.8.1980 held the termination to be illegal on ground of non-compliance of section 25F of the Act, though the order of discharge was issued under Standing Order 18(1). The Company has appealed against the said order. C.A. number 1868 of 1984 The respondent was an employee in the appellant's facto- ry as welder and his services were terminated with effect from 21.11.1972 under Standing Order number 28. The Labour Court by its Award dated 30.12.1980 held the order of termi- nation amounted to retrenchment and bad for non-compliance with section 25F and hence set it aside and ordered reinstatement with full back wages. Hence this appeal. C.A. number 8456 of 1983 The respondent was dismissed by the appellant--Corpora- tion after disciplinary inquiry by order dated 28.5.1971 paying one month's wages in advance. The workman having raised an industrial dispute, the Labour Court, Aurangabad by its Award dated 9.11.1979 held the order of termination to be legal and proper. The respondent's writ petition therefrom was allowed and the Award was quashed and the workman was declared entitled t0 reinstatement. Hence this appeal. C.A. number 10828 of 1983. The respondent was a store keeper of Rungta Colliery. His name was struck off the rolls of the Colliery with effect from 8.7.1975. He having raised an industrial dis- pute, the Industrial Tribunal, Jabalpur by its Award dated 22.8.1977 held the striking off t0 be unjustified and that the termination amounted to retrenchment and bad for non payment of retrenchment compensation. In the workman's Letters Patent Appeal the Division Bench of the High Court also held that the termination amounted to retrenchment. Hence this Management's appeal. The respective cases were argued with some dexterity by the learned counsel Mr. B.N. Singhvi, Mr. N.B. Shetye, Mr. S.S. Javali, Mr. K.K. Venugopal, Mr. V.A. Bobde, Mr. M.K. Ramamurthy, Mr. M.G. Ramachandran & Mr. R.S. Hegde. On the above diverse facts two rival contentions are raised by the parties. The learned counsel for the employers contend that the word 'retrenchment' as defined in section 2(00) of the Act means termination ofservice of a workman only by way of surplus labour for any reason whatsoever. The learned counsel representing the workmen counted that 'retrenchment' means termination of the service of a workman for any reason whatsoever, other than those expressly excluded by the definition in section 2(00) of the Act. The precise question to be decided, therefore, is whether on a proper construction of the definition of \"retrenchment\" in section 2(00) of the Act, it means termination by the employer of the service of a workman as surplus labour for any reason whatsoever, or it means termination by the employer of the service of a workman for any reason whatsoever, otherwise than as a punishment inflicted by way of disciplinary action, and those expressly excluded by the definition. In other words, the question to be decided is whether the word \"retrenchment\" in the definition has to be understood in its narrow, natural and contextual meaning or in its wider literal meaning. Mr. N.B. Shetye, Mr. K.K. Venugopal, and the learned counsel adopting their arguments refer to the introduction of the provision of \"retrenchment\" in the Act. Retrenchment was not defined either in the repealed Trade Disputes Act, 1929, or in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, as originally enacted. Owing to a crisis in the textile industry in Bom- bay, apprehending large scale termination of services of workmen, the Government of India issued an Ordinance which later became the Industrial Disputes (Amendment) Act, 1953 (Act 43 of 1953) which was deemed to have come into force on the 24th day of October, 1953. Besides introducing the definitions of \"lay-off\" [Clause 2 (kkk)] and \"Retrenchment\" [Clause 2(oo)] this Amendment Act of 1953 also inserted Chapter VII in the Act which dealt with \"lay-off\" and \"Retrenchment\". That Chapter contained sections 25A to 25J. Section 25A provided that sections 25C to 25E inclusive shall not apply to certain categories of industrial estab- lishments. Section 25C dealt with right of workmen laid-off compensation. Section 25D provided for maintenance of muster rolls of workmen by employers and section 25E stated the cases in which the workmen were not entitled to lay-off compensation. Section 25F dealt with conditions precedent to retrenchment of workmen. Section 25G dealt with procedure for retrenchment and section 25H dealt with re-employment of retrenched workmen; and section 25J dealing with the effect of laws inconsistent with this Chapter said that the provi- sions of this Chapter shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law (including standing orders made under the Industrial Employ- ment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946 (XX of 1946); provided that nothing contained in this Act shall have effect to derogate from any fight which a workman has under any award for the time being in operation or any contract with the employer. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Amendment Act, 1953 was as under: \"The Industrial Disputes (Amendment) Bill, 1953 seeks to provide for payment of compensation to workmen in the event of their lay-off or retrenchment. The provisions included in the Bill are not new and were discussed at various tripar- tite meetings. Those relating to lay-off are based on an agreement entered into between the representatives of em- ployers and workers who attended the 13th session of the Standing Labour Committee. In regard to retrenchment, the Bill provides that a workman who has been in continuous employment for not less than one year under an employer shall not be retrenched until he has been given one month's notice in writing or one month's wages in lieu of such notice and also a gratuity calculated at 15 days' average pay for every completed year of service or any part thereof in excess of six months. A similar provision was included in the Labour Relations Bill, 1950, which has since lapsed. Though compensation on the lines provided for in the Bill is given by all progressive employers, it is felt that a common standard should be set for all employers\" Clause 2(00) as inserted read as under: \"'Retrenchment' means the termination by the employer of the service of a workman for any reason whatsoever otherwise than as a punishment inflicted by way of disciplinary ac- tion, but does not include-- (a) voluntary retirement of the workman; or (b) retirement of the workman on reaching the age of super- annuation if the contract of employment between the employer and the workman concerned contains a stipulation in that behalf; or (c) termination of the service of a workman on the ground of continued ill health.\"We are referred to contemporaneous interpretation of the word \"retrenchment. In Employees of Messrs India Reconstruc- tion Corporation Ltd., Calcutta v. Messers. India Recon- struction Corporation Ltd., reported in 1953 LAC 563 it was observed by the Calcutta High Court: \"Ordinarily retrenchment means discharge from service of only the surplus part of the labour force but in the case of closure the whole labour force is dispensed with. In sub- stance the difference between closure and normal retrench- ment is one of degree only. As in the case of retrenchment so in the case of closure the workmen are not responsible for closing their jobs. In both the cases, what is called compensation by way of retrenchment relief should be admis- sible.\" In Messrs Benett Coleman and Company Ltd. v. Their Employees, reported in 1954 LAC 24 it was observed by Cal- cutta High Court: \"Thus whether the closure was justified or not, the workmen who have lost their jobs would in any event get compensa- tion. If it was not bona fide or not justified, it may be that the measure of compensation would be larger than if it was otherwise.\" The above almost contemporaneous exposition is worth consideration, Contemporanea expositio est optima et fortio- sima in lege, (2 Inst. 11). Contemporaneous exposition is the best and strongest in the law. A statute is best ex- plained by following the construction put upon it by judges who lived at the time it was made. In Pipraich Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Pipraich Sugar Mills Mazdoor Union, [1956] SCR 872, the appellant company could not work its mills to full capacity owing to short supply of sugar-cane and got the permission of the Government to sell its machinery but continued crushing cane under a lease from the purchaser. The workmen's union in order to frustrate the transaction resolved to go on strike and serving a strike notice did not cooperate with the management with the result that it lost heavily. On the expiry of the lease and closure of the industry, the services of the workmen were duly terminated by the company. The workmen claimed the share of profits on the basis of the offer earlier made by the compa- ny and accepted by the workers. The company having declined to pay and the dispute having been referred,the Industrial Tribunal held that the company was bound to pay and accordingly awarded a sum of Rupees 45,000 representing their share of the profits and the award was affirmed by the Labour Appellate Tribunal. Question before this Court in appeal was whether the termination of the workmen on the closure of the industry amounted to retrenchment. It was held that the award was not one for compensation for termi- nation of the services of the workmen on closure of the industry, as such discharge was different from the discharge on retrenchment, which implied the continuance of the indus- try and discharge only of the surplusage, and the workmen were not entitled either under the law as it stood on the day of their discharge or even on merits to any compensa- tion. The contention of the workmen was that even before the enactment of Industrial Disputes (Amendment) Act, 1953, the tribunal had acted on the view that the retrenchment includ- ed discharge on closure of business and had awarded compen- sation on that footing and that the award of the tribunal in Pipraich's case could be supported in that view and should not be disturbed. This was based on the decision in Employ- ees of Messrs India Reconstruction Corporation Ltd. Calcutta v. Messrs India Reconstruction Corporation Ltd., (supra); and Messrs Benett Coleman and Company Ltd. v. Their Employ- ees, (supra). But their Lordship did not agree. Venkatarama Ayyar, J. speaking for the four Judge Bench said: \"Though there is discharge of workmen both when there is retrenchment and closure of business, the compensation is to be awarded under the law, not for discharge as such but for discharge on retrenchment, and if, as is conceded, retrench- ment means in ordinary parlance, discharge of the surplus, it cannot include discharge on closure of business.\" As a result it was held that the Award in Pipraich was against the agreement and could not be supported as one of compensation to the workmen.Thus this Court in Pipraich (supra) was dealing with the question whether the discharge of the workmen on closure of the undertaking would constitute retrenchment and whether the workmen were entitled on that account to retrenchment compensation; and it was observed that retrenchment connoted in its ordinary acceptation that the business itself was being continued but that a portion of the staff orthe labour force was discharged as surplusage and the termi- nation of services of all the workmen as a result of the closure of the business could not, therefore, be properly described as retrenchment, which in the ordinary parlance meant discharge from the service and did not include dis- charge on closure of business. The same view was expressed in Hariprasad Shivshankar Shukla v. A.D. Divikar, [1957] SCR 121; also reported sub nomine Barsi Light Railway Co. v. K.N. Joglekar, [1957] 1 L.L.J. 243 (SC), wherein the Constitution Bench heard two appeals; namely, Civil Appeal numbers 103 and 105 of 1956. In Civil Appeal number 105 of 1956 the main appellant was the Barsi Light Railway Company Ltd., and the principal respond- ent was the President of the Barsi Light Railwaymen's Union. Under an agreement dated August 1, 1895 between the Secre- tary of State for India in Council and the Railway Company, the Secretary of State could purchase and take over the undertaking after giving Railway Company a notice. On Decem- ber 19, 1952 a notice was given to the Railway Company for and on behalf of the President of India that the undertaking of the Railway Company would be purchased and taken over as from January 1, 1954. On November 11, 1953, the Railway Company served a notice on its workmen intimating that as a result of the talking over, the services of all the workmen of the Railway Company would be terminated with effect from December 31, 1953. The notice further stated that the Gov- ernment of India intended to employ such of the staff of the company as would be willing to serve on the railway on terms and conditions which were to be notified later. About 77 per cent of the staff of the Railway Company were reemployed on the same scales of pay, about 23 per cent were reemployed on somewhat lower scales of pay and only about 24 per cent of the former employees of the Railway Company declined service under the Government. Applications for compensation having been filed on behalf of the erstwhile workmen of the Railway Company under section 15 of the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, for payment of retrenchment compensation to the said workmen under clause (b) of section 25F of the Act, the question was whether the erstwhile workmen were entitled to claim compen- sation under clause (b) of section 25F of the Act; and whether they had been retrenched by their former employer within the meaning of the expression 'retrenchment' in the Act. In Civil Appeal number 103 of 1956, the main appellant was Sri Dinesh Mills Ltd. Baroda and the principal respondent was District Labour Officer and Inspector under the Payment of Wages Act. The appellant company was running a woollen mill at Baroda and had abut 450 workmen and 20 clerks who worked in shifts day and night. On or about October 31,1953, the appellant put up a notice declaring its intention to close down the entire mill. As a result of the closure, the services of all 450 workmen and 20 clerks were terminat- ed and the appellant company claimed that the closure was bona fide being due to heavy losses sustained by the compa- ny. The principal respondent claimed retrenchment compensa- tion for the workmen of the appellant under clause (b) of s. 25F of the Act. Section 25F at the relevant time stood as follows: \"25F. Conditions precedent to retrenchment of workmen.--No workman employed in any industry who has been in continuous service for not less than one year under an employer shall be retrenched by that employer until-- (a) the workman has been given one month's notice in writing indicating the reasons for retrenchment and the period of notice has expired, or the workman has been paid in lieu of such notice, wages for the period of the notice; Provided that no such notice shall be necessary if the retrenchment is under an agreement which specifies a date for the termination of service; (b) the workman has been paid, at the time of retrenchment, compensation which shall be equivalent to fifteen days' average pay for every completed year of service or any part thereof in excess of six months; and (c) notice in the prescribed manner is served on the appro- priate Government.\" In both the appeals the question before the Constitu- tion Bench was whether the claim of the erstwhile workmen both of the Railway Company and of Shri Dinesh Mills Ltd., to the compensation under clause(b) of section 25F of the Act was a valid claim in law. Observing that the Act had a 'plexus of amendments', and some of the recent amendments had been quite extensive in nature and that section 25F occurred in Ch. VA of the Act which dealt with 'lay off and retrenchment' in the Amending Act, and analysing section 25F as it then stood, S.K. Das, J. speaking for the Constitution Bench observed that in the first part of the section both the words 're- trenched' and 'retrenchment' were used and obviously they had the same meaning except that one was verband the other was a noun and that to appreciate the true scope and effect of section 25F one must first understand what was meant by the expression 'retrenched' or 'retrenchment'- Analysing the definition of 'retrenchment' in section 2(00) the Court found in it the following four essential require- ments: (a) termination of the service of a workman;, (b) by the employer; (c) for any reason whatsoever; and (d) other- wise than as a punishment inflicted by way of disciplinary action. The Court then said: \"It must be conceded that the definition is in very wide terms. The question, however, before us is does this defini- tion merely give effect to the ordinary, accepted notion of retrenchment in an existing or running industry by embodying the notion in apt and readily intelligible words or does it go so far beyond the accepted notion of retrenchment as to include the termination of services of all workmen in an industry when the industry itself ceases to exist on a bona fide closure or discontinuance of his business by the em- ployer?\" The Court further said: \"There is no doubt that when the act itself provides a dictionary for the words used, we must look into that dic- tionary first for an interpretation of the words used in the statute. We are not concerned with any presumed intention of the legislature; our task is to get the intention as ex- pressed in the statute. Therefore, we propose first to examine the language of the definition and see if the ordi- nary, accepted notion of retrenchment fits in, squarely and fairly, with the language used.\" The Court reiterated the following observations in Pipraich (supra): \"But retrenchment connotes in its ordinary acceptation that the business itself is being continued but that a portion of the staff of the labour force is discharged as surplusage and the termination of services of all the workmen as a result of the closure of the business cannot therefore be properly described as retrenchment.\"This was the ordinary accepted notion of 'retrenchment' in an industry before addition of section 2(oo) to the Act, as retrenchment in that case took place in 1951. Replying to the argument that by excluding the bona fide closure of business as one of the reasons for termination of the serv- ice of workmen by the employer, one would be cutting down the amplitude of the expression 'for any reason whatsoever' and reading into the definition the words which did not occur there, the Court agreed that the adoption of the ordinary meaning would give to the expression 'for any reason whatsoever' a somewhat narrower scope; one might say that it would get a colour in the context in which expres- sion occurred; but the Court did not agree that it amounted to importing new words in the definition and said that the legislature in using that expression said in effect: \"It does not matter why you are discharging the surplus; if the other requirements of the definition are fulfilled, then it is retrenchment\". In the absence of any compelling words to indicate that the intention was to include bona fide closure of the whole business, it would be divorcing the expression altogether from its context to give it such a wide meaning as was contended. About the nature of the definition it was said: \"It is true that an artificial definition may include a meaning different from or in excess of the ordinary accepta- tion of the word which is the subject of definition; but there must then be compelling words to show that such a meaning different from or in excess of the ordinary meaning is intended. Where, within the framework of the ordinary acceptation of the word, every single requirement of the definition clause is fulfilled, it would be wrong to take the definition as destroying the essential meaning of the word defined.\" The Court in Hariprasad dealt with two other conten- tions; one was that before the amending Act of 1953 the retrenchment had acquired a special meaning which included the payment of compensation on a closure of business and the legislature gave effect to that meaning in the definition clause and by inserting section 25F. The second was that section 25FF inserted in 1956 by Act 41 of 1956 was 'Parlia- mentary exposition' of the meaning of the definition clause and of section 25F. Rejecting the contentions the Court held that retrenchment meant the discharge of surplus workmen in an existing or continuing business; it had acquired no special meaning so as to include discharge of workmen on bona fide closure of business, though a number of Labour Appellate Tribunals awarded compensation toworkmen on closure of business as an equitable relief for variety of reasons. The Court accordingly held: \"... that retrenchment as defined in section 2(00) and as used in section 25 has no wider meaning than the ordinary, accepted connotation of the word; it means the discharge of surplus labour or staff by the employer for any reason whatsoever, otherwise than as a punishment inflicted by way of discipli- nary action, and it has no application where the services of all workmen have been terminated by the employer on real and bona fide closure of business as in the' case of Shri Dinesh Mills Ld. or where the services of all workmen have been terminated by the employer on the business or undertaking being taken over by another employer in circumstances like those of the Railway Company.\" It is interesting to note that the Amending Act number 41 of 1956 inserted original section 25FF on September 4, 1956. The objects and reasons were stated thus: \"Doubt has been raised whether retrenchment compensation under the Industrial Disputes Act 1947 becomes payable by reason merely of the fact that there has been a change of employers, even if the service of the workman is continued without interruption and the terms and conditions of his service remain unaltered. This has created difficulty in the transfer, re-constitution and amalgamation of companies and it is proposed to make the intention clear by amending section 25F of the Act.\" Hariprasad's case (supra) was decided on November 27, 1956. The Industrial Disputes (Amendment) Ordinance, 1957 (4 of 1957) was promulgated immediately thereafter with effect from December 1, 1956 and that Ordinance was replaced by the Industrial Disputes (Amendment) Act 1957 (XVIII of 1957). The following was the Statement of Objects and Reasons: \"In a judgment delivered on the 27th November, 1956, the Supreme Court held that no retrenchment compensation was payable under section 25F of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, to workmen whose services were terminated by an em- ployer on a real and bona fide closure of business, or when termination occurred as a result of transfer of owner-ship from one employer to another (see AIR 1957 SC 12 1). This has led and is likely to lead to a large number of workmen being rendered unemployed without any compensa- tion. In order to meet this situation which was causing hardship to workmen, it was considered necessary to take immediate action and the Industrial Disputes (Amendment) Ordinance, 1957 (4 of 1957), was promulgated with retrospec- tive effect from 1st December, 1956.\" \"This Ordinance was replaced by an Act of Parliament enact- ing the provisions contained in sections 25FF and 25FFF. These sections provide that 'compensation would be payable to workmen whose services are terminated on account of the transfer or closure of undertakings.' In the case of trans- fer of undertakings, however, if the workman is re-employed on terms and conditions which are not less favourable to him, he will not be entitled to any compensation. This was the position which existed prior to the decision of the Supreme Court. In the case of closure of business on account of the circumstances beyond the control of the employer, the maximum compensation payable to workmen has been limited to his average pay for three months. If the undertaking is engaged in any construction work and it is closed down within two years on account of the completion of its work, no compensation would be payable to workmen employed there- in.\" Hariprasad (supra) having accepted the ordinary contex- tual meaning of retrenchment, namely, termination of surplus labour as the major premise it was surely open to the Par- liament to have amended the definition of retrenchment in s. 2(00) of the Act. Instead of doing that the Parliament added section 25FF and 25FFF which said: \"25FF. Compensation to workmen in case of transfer of under- takings--Where the ownership or management of an undertaking is transferred, whether by agreement or by operation of law, from the employer, in relation to that undertaking to a new employer, every workman who has been in continuous service for not less than one year in that undertaking immediately before such transfer shall be entitled to notice and compen- sation in accordance with the provisions of section 25F, as if the workman had been retrenched: Provided that nothing in this section shall apply to a workman in any case where there has been a change of employers by reason of the transfer, if-- (a) the service of the workman has not been interrupted by such transfer; (b) the terms and conditions of service applicable to the workman after such transfer are not in any way less favour- able to the workman than those applicable to him immediately before the transfer; and (c) the new employer is under the terms of such transfer or otherwise, legally liable to pay to the workman, in the event of his retrenchment, compensation on the basis that his service has been continuous and has not been interrupted by the transfer.\" \"25FFF. Compensation to workmen in case of closing down of undertakings--(1) Where an undertaking is closed down for any reason whatsoever, every workman who has been in contin- uous service for not less than one year in that undertaking immediately before such closure shall, subject to the provi- sions of sub-section (2), be entitled to notice and compen- sation in accordance with the provisions of section 25-F, as if the workman had been retrenched; Provided that where the undertaking is closed down on account of unavoidable circumstances beyond the control of the employer, the compensation to be paid to the workmen under clause (b) of section 25-F shall not exceed his aver- age pay for three months.\" Thus, by this Amendment Act the Parliament clearly provided that though such termination may not have been retrenchment technically so-called, as decided by this Court, neverthe- less the employees in question whose services were terminat- ed by the transfer or closure of the undertaking would be entitled to compensation, as if the said termination was retrenchment. As it has been observed, the words \"as if\" brought out the legal distinction between retrenchment defined by section 2(00) as it was interpreted by this Court and termination of services consequent upon transfer of the undertaking. In other words, the provision was that though termination of services on transfer or closure ofthe undertaking may not be retrenchment, the workmen con- cerned were entitled to compensation as if the said termina- tion was retrenchment. Thus we find that till then the accepted meaning of retrenchment was ordinary, contextual and narrower meaning of termination of surplus labour for any reason whatsoever. In Anakapalla Co-operative Agricultural and Industrial Society Ltd. v. Workmen, [1963] Suppl. 1 SCR 730, a company running a sugar mill was suffering losses every year due to insufficient supply of sugarcane and wanted to shift the mill. The cane-growers formed a co-operative society and purchased the mill. As agreed between the company and the society, the company terminated the services of the employ- ees and paid retrenchment compensation to them under section 25FF of the Act. This society employed some of the old employees and refused to absorb some of them who raised an industrial dispute. The Industrial Tribunal having directed the purchaser-society by its award to re-employ them, the society contended that it was not a successor in-interest of the company and hence the claim of re-employment was not sustainable and the services of the employees having been terminated upon payment of compensation by the company under section 25FF no claim could be made against the transferee socie- ty. This Court held that the society was the successor-in- interest of the company as it carried on the same or similar business as was carried by the vendor company at the same place and without substantial break in continuity. It was further held that the employees were not entitled to both compensation for termination of service and immediate re- employment at the hands of the transferee and section 25H was not applicable to the case as the termination of service upon transfer or closure was not retrenchment properly so called and that termination of service dealt with in section 25FF could not be equated with retrenchment covered by section 25F. It was observed that the words 'as if' in section 25FF clearly distinguished retrenchment under section 2(00) and termination under section 25FF. Gajendragadkar, J., as he then was, speaking for the five Judges Bench said that in Hariprasad this Court was called upon to consider the true scope and effect of the concept of retrenchment as defined in section 2(00) and it held that the said definition had to be read in the light of the accepted connotation of the words, and as such, it could have no wider meaning than the ordinary connotation of the word and according to this connotation retrenchment meant the discharge of surplus labour or staff by the employer for any reason whatsoever, otherwise' then as a punishment inflicted by way of disciplinary action, and didnot include termination of services of all workmen on the bona fide closure of industry or on change of ownership or management thereof. It was observed: \" ..... the effect of this decision was that though the definition of the word 'retrenchment' may perhaps have included the termination of services caused by the closure of the concern or by its transfer, these two latter cases could not be held to fall under the definition because of the ordinary accepted connotation of the said word."}, "annotations": [{"result": [{"value": {"start": 0, "end": 71, "text": "CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal numbers 3241-48 of 1981 Etc.", "labels": ["PREAMBLE"]}}, {"value": {"start": 72, "end": 446, "text": "From the Judgment and Order dated 20.7.1983 of the Punjab & Haryana High Court in C.W.P. numbers 469,748,750,751,752 and 753 of 1981 B.N.

Dada- chanji, O. C. Mathur and Ravinder Narain, for the appellant.S. K. Kapur and R. H. Dhebar., for respondent number 1. S. T. Desai, J. L. Jain and V. J. Merchant, for respondent number 2. February 7, 1964. The Judgment of Gajendragadkar C.J., Wanchoo and Rajagopala Ayyangar JJ. was delivered by Gajendragadkar C.J. The dissenting opinion of Sarkar and Das Gupta JJ. was delivered by Das Gupta J. GAJENDRAGADKAR C.J.-The short question of law which arises for our decision in the present appeal is whether the proceeding before an Income-tax Officer under section 37 of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 (number XI of 1922) (hereinafter called the Act) can be said to be a proceeding in any court within the meaning of section 195(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This question arises in this way. The appellant Lalji Haridas and respondent number 2 Mulii Maniial Kamdar are businessmen and they carry oil their business in Jamnagar and Bombay respectively. They have known each other for several years past in the course of their ordinary business activities. In the income-tax assessment proceedings of the appellant for the assessment years 1949-50 and 1950-51, respondent number 2 gave evidence on oath before the Income-tax Officer, Ward A, Jamnagar on the 4th December, 1958. In his evidence he denied that he had a son named Nihal Chand and that he had done any business in the name of M/section Nihal Chand & Co. at Jamnagar. According to the appellant, the said statements were false to the knowledge of respondent number 2 and were made by him to mislead the Income-tax Officer and to avoid the incidence of income-tax on himself. As a re. sult of the said false statements, the appellant was heavily taxed. On the 24th November, 1959, the appellant filed a criminal complaint against respondent number 2 under section 193 of the Indian Penal Code (number 452/S of 1959) in the Court of the Presidency Magistrate, 19th Court, Esplanades, Bombay. At the hearing of the said complaint, respondent number 2 raised a preliminary objection that the learned Magistrate could not take cognizance of the said complaint, because the proceedings in which he was alleged to have made a false statement on oath were proceedings before a Court within the meaning of section 195 (1) (b) Criminal . P.C., and since no complaint in writing had been made by the Court of the Income-tax Officer before which the said proceedings were conducted, the provisions of section 1 95 (1) (b) created a bar against the competence of the appellant's complaint. The learned Presi- dency Magistrate held that the Income-tax Officer was not a Court within the meaning of section 195(1) (b), Criminal . P.C., and so, he rejected the preliminary objection raised by respondent number 2. Against the said decision of the Presidency Magistrate, respondent number 2 preferred a Criminal Revision Application (number 1142 of 1960) before the Bombay High Court. The State of Maharashtra was impleaded as respondent number 1 to the said Revision Application. A Division Bench of the said High Court reversed the conclusion of the Presidency Magistrate and held that the Income-tax Officer was a Court within the meaning of section 195(1) (b), Criminal . P.C., and so, it upheld the preliminary objection raised by respondent number 2. In the result, the complaint filed by the appellant was ordered to be dismissed. The appellant then applied for and obtained a certificate from the Bombay High Court under article 134(1) (c) of the Constitution and it is with the said certificate that he has brought the present appeal before us. That is how the narrow question which arises for our decision in the present appeal is whether the proceedings before an Income- tax Officer are proceedings in any Court under section 195(1)(b), Criminal . P.C. The question thus raised is undoubtedly a short one, but its decision is not easy, because the arguments urged in support of the two respective constructions are fairly balanced and the task of preferring one construction to the other presents some difficulty. The proceedings before the Income-tax Officer during which, according to the appellant, respondent number 2 made a false statement on oath, were held by the Income-tax Officer under section 37 of the Act. Section 37(1) deals with the powers of Income-tax authorities and provides, inter alia, that the Income-tax Officer shall, for the purposes of the Act have the same powers as are vested in a Court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (number V of 1908), when trying a suit inrespect of the matters specified by clauses (a) to (d). Section 37(2) confers upon the Income-tax Officer certain additional powers which can be exercised subject to any rules made in that behalf, provided the said Officer is specially authorised by the Commissioner in that behalf, and in exercising these powers, the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 relating to searches apply. Section 37(3) deals with the question of impounding and retaining any books of account or other documents. That takes us to section 37(4) which is relevant for our purpose; this section provides that any proceeding before any authority referred to in this section shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of sections 193 and 228, and for the purposes of section 196 of the Indian Penal Code. It is thus clear that while the Income-tax Officer exercises his powers under section 37(1), (2) and (3) the proceedings held by him arc judicial proceedings for the purposes of the three sections of the Indian Penal Code mentioned in sub- section (4). Therefore, the question as to whether the false statement alleged to have been made by respondent number 2 was made by him at any stage of a judicial proceeding within the meaning of section 193 I.P.C., must be answered in the affirmative. That is the plain effect of section 37(4) of the Act. Section 193 of the Indian Penai Code. with which we are directly concerned in the present appeal provides for punishment for intentionally giving false evidence. It consists of two parts; the first part deals, inter alia, with false evidence intentionally given in any stage of a judicial proceeding, and prescribes that the person found guilty of having given such false evidence in a judicial proceeding shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable lo fine; the second part deals with cases where false evidence has been intentionally given in any other case, and it prescribes the maximum sentence of three years as well as fine. In other words, if the false evidence has been intentionally given in any judicial proceeding, the sentence awardable is higher than that where false evidence is intentionally given in proceedings which are not judicial. There are three explanations to section 193. Expln. I provides that a trial before a Court-martial is a judicial proceeding; expln. 2 lays down that an investi- gation directed by law preliminary to a proceeding before a Court of Justice, is a stage of a judicial proceeding, though that investigation may not take place before a Court of Justice; this explanation takes in, for instance, committal proceedings. Under expln. 3, an investigation directed by a Court ,of Justice according to law, and conducted under the authority of a Court of Justice, is a stage of a judicial proceeding, though that investigation may not take place before a Court of Justice. This explanation covers enquiries before officers deputed by Courts of Justice to ascertain, for instance, on the spot the boundaries of land. It would thus be seen that having provided for a higher sentence in regard to the offence of giving false evidence in any stage of a judicial proceeding, the three explanations of section 193 include within the expression \"judicial proceeding\" certain proceedings which on a strict construction of the said expression may not have been included under it. For the purpose of the present appeal, however, the only point to notice at this stage is that section 37(4) of the Act makes a proceeding before an Income-tax Officer, held under the said section, a judicial proceeding for the purposes of section 193, I.P.C. and that means that if an offence of giving false evidence is proved to have been committed by a person in a proceeding before the Income-tax Officer, he would be liable for the higher sentence awardable under the first part of section 193. That takes us to section 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is well-known that section 195 provides for an ex- ception to the ordinary rule that any person can make a complaint in respect of the commission of an offence triable under the Criminal . P. C. Section 4(h) of this Code defines a \"complaint\" as meaning the allegation made orally or in writing to a Magistrate, with a view to his taking action under the Code, that some person, whether known or unknown, has committed an offence, but does not include the report of a police officer. This definition shows that any person can make a complaint in respect of the commission of an offence. Section 190 requires that the Magistrate to whom a complaint has been made should take cognizance of the said complaint, subject to the provisions of the said section. Thus, the general rule is that any person can make a complaint, and s. 195 provides for an exception. Section 195(1) 134-159 S.C.-45(b)with which we are concerned, provides that no Court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under the sections therein mentioned, when such offence is alleged to have been committed in, or in relation to, any proceeding in any Court, except the complaint in writing of such Court, or of some other Court to which such Court is subordinate, amongst the sections mentioned are sections 193 and 228 I.P.C. The effect of these provisions is that if an offence is alleged to have been committed either under section 193 or section 228 I.P.C., and it appears that the said offence was committed in relation to any proceeding in any Court, it is only if the said Court, or the Court to which it is subordinate, makes a complaint in that behalf that cognizance will be taken of the said complaint. A person cannot make a complaint in respect of the alleged commission of any of the offences specified in section 195(1)(b); that is its plain effect. Section 195(2) which was added in 1923 when the earlier section 195 was substantially amended, provides that in clauses (b) and (c) of sub-section (1) the term \"Court\" in- cludes a Civil, Revenue or Criminal Court, but it does not include a Registrar or Sub-Registrar under the Indian Regis- tration Act, 1877. It is unnecessary to deal with the effect of this provision, because, as will presently appear we do not propose to base our decision on the ground that the Income-tax Officer is a Revenue Court under this sub- section. The only point of interest to which we may incidentally refer is that this sub-section gives an inclusive, though not an exhaustive, definition and takes within its purview not only Civil and Criminal Courts, but also Revenue Courts, while excluding a Registrar or Sub- Registrar under the Indian Registration Act. In dealing with the question which has been raised in the present appeal what we are required to determine is whether a proceeding before an Income-tax Officer which by virtue of the operation of s.37(4) of the Act, must be held to be a judicial proceeding under section 193, I.P.C. is a proceeding in any Court under section 195. Criminal . P. C. Section 193 makes a dis- tinction between offences committed in any judicial proceed- ing and those committed in proceedings other than judicial proceedings, whereas section 195(1)(b), Criminal . P. C. does not refer to judicial proceedings as such, but mentions proceedings inany Court. That is why the controversy between the parties in the present appeal lies within a very narrow compass. Can it be said that the proceeding which is a judicial proceeding under section 193, I.P.C., must be held to be a proceeding in any Court under section 195(1)(b), Criminal . P. C.? It is on this aspect of the dispute that the arguments on both sides are fairly balanced. In dealing with this question, it is unnecessary to consider what would have been the position of the Income-tax Officer acting under section 37(1), (2) and (3), and what would have been the character of the proceedings taken before him if sub- section (4) had not been enacted. In Jagannath Prasad v. The State of Uttar Pradesh(1), it has been held by this Court that the Sales-tax Officer functioning under the U.P. Sales Tax Act, 1948 (number 15 of 1948) was not a Court within the meaning of section 195, Criminal . P.C., and so, it was not necessary for him to make a complaint for the prosecution of any person against whom it was alleged that he had committed an offence,under section 471 I.P.C. This decision would tend to indicate that in the absence of section 37(4) it would have become necessary to hold that the Income-tax Officer acting under section 37(1), (2) and (3), would not be a Court under s. 195, Criminal . P.C., and in that sense the provisions of section 195 could not have been attracted. This position is not disputed by Mr. Desai who appears for respondent number 2. He, however, contends that the provisions of section 37(4) which have been inserted in the Act in 1956 make all the difference, and according to him, this sub-section was added in order to make section 195 (1) (b), Criminal . P. C., applicable to the proceedings before the Income-tax Officer. On the other hand, the Additional Solicitor-General has strenuously argued that the purpose which the legislature had in mind in inserting sub-section (4) in section 37 was merely to make the proceedings before the Income-tax Officer judicial proceedings within the meaning of section 193, I.P.C., and not to make section 195 (1) (b), Criminal . P. C. applicable to them. If the intention of the legislature had been to take the proceedings before the Income-tax Officer within the mischief of the said section of the Criminal . P.C., the legislature would have expressly said so in terms. The (1) [1953]2 S.C.R. 850omission to refer to the relevant provision of the Criminal . P.C. in section 37(4) is not accidental, but deliberate, and so, though the proceeding before the Income-tax Officer may be and has to be regarded as a judicial proceeding under s. 193, I.P.C., it cannot be said to be a proceeding before a Court, because the Income-tax Officer is not a Court. In support of his argument, the Additional Solicitor General has referred us to several statutes where the legislative intention to extend the provisions of section 195, Criminal . P.C., to specific proceedings has been carried out by making an express provision in that behalf. Section 23 of the Work- men's Compensation Act, 1923 (number 8 of 1923) provides that the Commissioner shall have all the powers of a Civil Court for the purposes therein indicated, and by an amendment made in 1929, it further lays down that the Commissioner shall be deemed to be a Civil Court for all the purposes of section 195 and Chapter 35 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The argument is that where the legislature wanted to extend the provisions of section 195, Criminal . P.C. to the proceedings before the Commissioner held under the Workmen's Compensation Act, it thought it necessary to make a specific and express provision in that behalf.. A similar provision is contained in section 18 of the Payment of Wages Act, 1936 (number 4 of 1936). In the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (number 14 of 1947), the position is similar to that in the case of the Workmen's Compensation Act; section 11(4) confers on the authorities therein specified powers as are vested in a Civil Court in respect of the matter mentioned therein. In 1950, sub- section (8) was added to section II by which it was provided that every Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal shall be deemed to be Civil Court for the purposes of sections 480 and 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This scheme also shows, says the Additional Solicitor-General, that where the legislature wants to make any Tribunal or authority a Court, it uses express and appropriate language in that behalf. Section 45 of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act, 1950 (number 31 of 1950) likewise confers powers of a Civil Court on the Custodian and expressly adds that the proceedings before him shall be deemed to be judicial proceedings within the meaning of sections 193 and 228 of the Indian Penal Code, and the Custodian shall be deemedto be a Court within the meaning of sections 480 and 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The same provision is made by section 17 of the Evacuee Interest (Separation) Act. 1951 (Act 64 of 1951), as well as by section 26 of the Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act, 1954 (number 44 of 1954). On the other hand, section 51 of the ministrator-General's Act, 1913 (number 3 of 1913) provides that whoever, during any examination authorised by this Act, makes a false statement on oath knowingly, he shall be deemed to have intentionally given false evidence in a stage of a judicial proceeding The argument is that in this case, the legislature wanted to equate the proceedings under this Act with judicial proceed- ings under section 193, I.P.C., and did not intend to make sec- tion 195, Criminal . P.C., applicable to them, because it does not make the authority under this Act a Court, or does not, in terms, extend the provisions of the said section to the pro- ceedings held before such an authority. The same comment has been made on the provisions of section 171A(4) of the Sea Customs Act, 1878 (number 8 of 1878). Thus presented, the argument is no doubt attractive and cannot be rejected as without any substance. The expression \"judicial proceeding\" is not defined in the Indian Penal Code, but we have the definition of the said expression under s., 4(m) of the Criminal . Procedure Code. Section 4(m) provides that \"judicial proceeding\" includes any proceeding in the course of which evidence is or may be legally taken on oath. The expression \"Court\" is not defined either by the Criminal . P.C. or the I.P.C. though 'Court of Justice' is defined by section 20 of the latter Code as denoting a Judge who is empowered by law to act judicially alone, or a body of Judges which is empowered by law to act judicially as a body, when such Judge or body of Judges is acting judicially. Section 3 of the Evidence Act defines a \"Court\" as including all Judges and Magistrates and all persons except the Arbitrators legally authorised to take evidence.Prima facie, there is some force in the conten- tion that it would not be reasonable to predicate about every ,judicial proceeding that it is a proceeding before a Court, and so, it is open to the appellant to urge that though the proceeding before an Income-tax Officer may be a judicialproceeding under section 193, I.P.C., it would not follow that the said judicial proceeding is a proceeding in a Court as required by section 195(i)(b), Criminal . P.C. It is somewhat remarkable that though section 193, I.P.C., refers to a judicial proceeding, section 195, Criminal . P.C. refers to a proceeding in any Court; it does not say a judicial proceeding in any Court. Mr. Desai contends that reading section 193 I.P.C. and section 195(1)(b) Criminal . P.C., together. it would not be unreasonable to hold that proceedings which are judicial under the former, should be taken to be proceedings in any Court under the latter. The whole basis of providing for a higher sentence in regard to offences committed at any stage of a judicial proceeding appears to be that the legislature took the view that the said offences were more serious in character, and so, it distinguished the said offences from similar offences committed at any stage of other proceedings. The argument is that while providing for a higher sentence in respect of this more serious class of offences committed at any stage of judicial proceedings, the legislature intended that there should be a safeguard in respect of complaint as regards the said offences and that safeguard is provided by s. 195(1)(b), Criminal P.C. In other words, an offence which is treated as more serious by the first paragraph of section 193, I.P.C. because it is an offence committed during the course of a judicial proceeding should be held to be an offence committed in any proceeding in any Court for the purpose of section 195(1)(b) Criminal P.C. On this argument, it is necessary to consider whether the Income-tax Officer is a Court or not, for, in substance, the contention is that as soon as s. 37(4) of the Act was enacted, the proceedings before an Income-tax Officer became judicial proceedings for the purpose of section 193, I.P.C. and since they are classed under the first paragraph of the said section, they attract the protection of section 195(1)(b), Criminal P.C. In our opinion, there is considerable force in this argument, and, on the whole. we are inclined to prefer the construction suggested by Mr. Desai to that pressed before us by the learned Additional Solicitor-General. It is true, the Additional Solicitor-General has mainly relied upon the relevant provisions of several statutes in support of his construction and in so far as it appears that certain provisions in some of the said statutes in terms extend the application of section 195, Criminal . P.C. to the proceedings to which they relate, the argument does receive support, but we hesitate to hold that the omission to refer to section 195(1) (b), Criminal . P.C. in section 37(4) of the Act necessarily means that the intention of the legislature in enacting section 37(4) was merely and solely to provide for a higher sentence in regard to the offence under section 193, I.P.C. if it was committed in proceedings before the Income- tax Officer. It is plain that if the argument of the Additional Solicitor-General is accepted, the result would be that a complaint like the present can be made by any person and if the offence alleged is proved, the accused would be liable to receive hi-her penalty awardable under the first paragraph of section 193, I.P.C. without the safeguard correspondingly provided by section 195(1)(b), Criminal . P.C. Could it have been the intention of the legislature in making the offence committed during the course of a proceeding before an Income-tax Officer more serious without affording a corresponding safeguard in respect of the complaints which -can be made in that behalf? We are inclined to hold that the answer to this question must be in the negative. That is why after careful consideration. we have come to the conclusion that the view taken by the Bombay High Court should be upheld though for different reasons. Section 37(4) ,of the Act makes the proceedings before the Income- tax Officer judicial proceedings under section 193 I.P.C. and these judicial proceedings must be treated as proceedings in any Court for the purpose of section 195(1)(b), Criminal . P.C. That. we think, would really carry out the intention of the legislature in enacting section 37(4) of the Act. In this connection. there is another consideration which has weighed in our minds. We have already noticed that section 37(4) makes the proceedings before the Income-tax Officer judicial proceedings within the meaning of section 228 I.P.C. When we turn to the latter section, we notice that the said section deals with the offence of intentionally causing insult or interruption to public servant sitting in judicial proceed- ing. It is obvious that the offence with which section 228 deals is an offence committed against a public servant sitting in a judicial proceeding. This section is one of the sections mentioned in section 195(1)(b), Criminal . P.C., and so. any complaint inrespect of the offence alleged to have been committed under section 228, I.P.C. has to be made by the Court in question. There can be little doubt that if a person offers an insult to a public servant sitting in a judicial proceeding, or causes. interruption to him while he is so sitting at any stage of the judicial proceeding, the complaint has to proceed from the public servant himself; that is the effect of section 195(1)(b) Criminal . P.C. Before section 37(4) of the Act was enacted, an insult given to an Income-tax Officer or interruption caused to his proceedings whilst he was conducting his proceedings, would not have amounted to an offence under section 228, I.P.C. Section 37(4) makes a proceeding before the Income-tax Officer a proceeding under section 228 I.P.C. and thus, an interruption in his proceedings, or an insult given to him, has now become punishable under the said section. Could it have been intended by the legislature in enacting section 37(4) that whereas an insult offered to a public servant acting judicially, or interruption caused in his proceedings would normally be cognizable only on the complaint of the public servant him- self, the same offence, if committed in respect of the proceedings before an Income-tax Officer, should be cognizable at the complaint of a private party? The anomaly which would result if the construction suggested by the Additional Solicitor-General is accepted, is, in our opinion, so glaring that the alternative contention urged by Mr. Desai and upheld by the Bombay High Court which avoids the said anomaly appears to be more reasonable and more consistent with the true intention of the legislature. That is why we are not prepared to accept the appellant's argument that the Bombay High Court was in error in dismissing his complaint on the ground that the condition precedent prescribed by section 195(1) (b) Criminal . P.C. had not been complied with as no complaint had been filed by the Income-tax Officer. It appears that In re: Punam Chand Maneklal(1) the Full Bench of the Bombay High Court had taken the view that an Income-tax Collector is a Revenue Court within the meaning of that term as used in clauses (b) and (c) of section 195, Criminal . P C., 1898. Scott, C. J. who spoke for the Full Bench, observed that it could not be contended that the Income-tax Collector was a Civil or Criminal Court, and so, he addressed himself (1) I.L.R. 38 Bom. 642.to the narrow question as to whether he was a Revenue Court. Dealing with the question on that footing, he examined the functions of the Income-tax Collector under Act 11 of 1886, and held that he was a Revenue Court. He rejected the contention that he could be treated as a Registrar or Sub- Registrar under the Registration Act, and so, he found no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that he was a Revenue Court. The Bombay High Court in the present case has substantially based itself on this decision in reversing the conclusion of the Presidency Magistrate and directing that the complaint filed by the appellant should be dismissed. It is unnecessary to consider whether the view taken by the Full Bench in re: Punam Chand Maneklal(1) is right, because the relevant provisions of the Income-tax Act have been subsequently modified in 1922 and different considerations have now assumed importance. It is no longer possible to hold that the Income-tax Officer is a Revenue Court, and, indeed, that has not been the contention raised before us by Mr. Desai. In the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed. DAS GUPTA, J.-Is an Income-tax Officer under the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, a court within the meaning of clause (b) in sub-section (1) of section 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure? That is the short but difficult question that arises in this appeal against a decision of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay. On November 24, 1949, the appellant filed a complaint in the Court of the Presidency Magistrate, Bombay, alleging that when the respondent Mulji Manilal Kamdar was examined on commission by the Income-tax Officer, Jamnagar Circle, Jamnagar, he gave answers which were false to his knowledge. He prayed for the issue of process against the said Mulji Manilal Kamdar, so that he might be dealt with according to law. An objection was raised by the accused that in the absence of a complaint by the Income-tax Officer before whom the false statement was alleged to have been made the Magistrate was debarred from taking cognizance of the case. This contention was based on a submission that the Income-tax Officer was a court within the meaning of section 195(1)(b). This objection was rejected by the Presidency Magistrate. (1) I.L.R. 38 Boni. 642.The High Court of Bombay was moved against the Presidency Magistrate's order. But considering itself bound by a Full Bench decision of the Court in in re: Punainchand Manieklal(1) and the later decision in State v. Nemchand Peshvir (2) the High Court held that an income-tax Officer when holding proceedings under section 23 of the Income-tax Act, 1922 is a Revenue Court within the meaning of clause (b) in sub-section (1) of section 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The correctness of the High Court's view is challenged before us by the complainant on the strength of a certificate granted by the High Court finder article 134(1) (c) of the Constitution. Section 195(1)(b) is one of the group of sections in the Code of Criminal Procedure which have laid down exceptions to the general rule of criminal law that criminal proceedings can be instituted in a court by any person. To this rule section 195 along with ss. 196, 196A, 197, 197A, 198, 198A, and 199 provide exceptions. Section 195 mentions in its first sub-section a number of offences of which no court shall take cognizance except on the complaint in writing of the persons as indicated. Three classes of offences are dealt with in three cls. (a), (b) and (c) of this sub- section. Section 195(1)(a) deals with offences punishable under ss. 172 to 188 of the Indian Penal Code and provides that no Court shall take cognizance of any of these except on the complaint in writing \"of the public servant concerned or of some other public servant to whom he is subordinate.\" Section 195(1)(b) deals with offences punishable under ss. 193, 194, 195, 196, 199, 200, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211 and 228 and provides that when any such offence is alleged to have been committed in or in relation to any proceeding in any court, no court shall take cognizance of it except on the complaint in writing of such Court or some other court to which such court is subordinate. Section 195(1)(c) deals with offences punishable under ss. 463, 471, 475 and 476 and provides that when any such offence is alleged to have been committed by a party to any proceeding in any court in respect of any document produced (1) I.L.R. 38 Bom. 642. (2) 57 Bom. L.R. 1056.or given in evidence in such proceeding, no court shall take cognizance of the same except on the complaint in writing of such court, or some other court to which such court is subordinate. The second sub-section of section 195 runs thus \"In clauses (b) and (c) of sub-section (1), the term \"court\" includes a Civil, Revenue or Criminal Court, but does not include a Registrar, or SubRegistrar, under the Indian Registration Act, 1877. \" In this appeal we are concerned directly with clause (b) of s. 195(1). The appellant's complaint before the Magistrate alleged the commission of an offence under section 193 of the Indian Penal Code in the course of the examination on oath by the Income-taxx Officer, Ward A, Jamnagar Circle, Jamnagar. The examination itself took place in relation to assessment proceedings against the complainant for the years 1949-50, and 1950-51. If the Income-tax Officer is a Court it necessarily follows that the Magistrate was not entitled to take cognizance of this offence except on the complaint of the Income-tax Officer. That is how the question whether the Income-tax Officer is a Court or not falls to be considered. Section 5 of the Income-tax Act, 1922, mentions six classes of Income-tax Authorities for ;the purposes of the Act, The primary function of an Income-tax Officer is the assessment of income that is chargeable to tax under section 3 of the Act and the determination of the tax payable on it. He has to perform other functions under the Act that are subsidiary and ancillary to this main function. Under section 5 (7) the Income-tax Officers are subordinate to the Director of Inspection, the Commissioner of Income-tax and the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner of Income-tax within whose jurisdiction they perform their functions. Under section 5(8) they have to observe and follow the orders, instructions and directions of the Central Board of Revenue. Chapter III of the Act in its several sections state what heads of income- profits and gains shall be chargeable to income-tax and indicates the duties which the Income-tax Officerhas to perform for the purpose of his main function of assessing the chargeable income. For instance, deductions under section 7 (2) (iia) in respect of conveyance owned by the assessee or used by him for the purpose of his employment\"shall be such sum as the Income-tax Officer may estimate,........\"The allowances permissible under s. 10(2)(i) \"shall be such sum as the Income-tax Officer may determine\"; the allowances under section 10 (2) (ix) also shall be such sum in respect of loans made in the ordinary course of business as the Income-tax Officer may estimate to be irrecoverable. Again, the allowances mentioned in clause (a) and clause (b) of section 10(4) (a) cannot be made \"if in the opinion of the Income-tax Officer any such allowance is excessive or unreasonable.\" The proviso to section 10(5) requires -the Income-tax Officer to satisfy himself in the cases dealt with there whether the main purpose of the transfer of assets was the reduction of liability to income-tax and provides that where he is so satisfied the actual cost of the assets shall be such amount as the Income-tax Officer may determine. Other sections showing the different matters in which the Income-tax Officer has to be satisfied or to form an opinion for the purpose of assessment are ss. 12(a), 13 and 17. Chapter IV of the Act,which lays down the proce- dure to be followed in making the assessment, imposes inter alia the duty of calling for returns of income (section 22); of making assessment of the Income and to determine the sum payable by the assessee (section 23); the power to assess Companies to super-tax (section 23A); the power to make provi- sional assessment in advance of regular assessment (section 23B). It is obvious however that for carrying out these several functions properly it is necessary for the Income-tax Officer to examine documents and persons. Power for this purpose are conferred on the Income-tax Officer (and certain other Income-tax Authorities) in section 37 of the Act. The first subsection of section 3 7 runs thus :- \"The Income-tax Officer, Appellate Assistant Commissioner and Appellate Tribunal shall, for the purposes of this Act, have the same powers as are vested in a court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) when trying a suit in respect of the following matters, namely :- (a) discovery and inspection. (b) enforcing the attendance of any person, including any officer of a banking company, and examining him on oath, (c) compelling the production of books of account and other documents; and (d) issuing summons.\" The second subsection empowers any Income-tax Officer specially authorised by the Commissioner to enter and search any building and seize books of account and other documents. Under the third sub-section the Income-tax Officer may impound or retain the books of account and other documents after following certain procedure. The fourth sub-section of this section which does not confer any powers but has been relied on strongly by the respondent will be dealt with in full detail later in this judgment. From the brief summary of the Income-tax Officer's functions given above it is clear that he is a part and parcel of the executive organ of the State. The fact that for carrying out some of these executive functions he will have the powers as are vested in a court under the Code of Civil Procedure has not the effect of converting him into a limb ,of the judicial organ. It has been held that he is a quasi judicial authority. That is not sufficient however to make him a court. Before we can call him a court, he must be shown to be a part of the judicial organ of the State. Leaving out for later consideration the effect of section 37(4) it is clear that an Income-tax Officer is not a court. We have not thought it necessary to refer to the numerous decisions of the High Courts in India, of this Court or of the Privy Council in which the question of what is a court has been considered. We have considered this unnecessary in view especially of the fact that most of these were noticed in a recent decision of this Court in Jagannath Prosad v. State of Uttar Pradesh(1) where the question whether a Sales Tax Officer was a court or not within the meaning of section 195(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code was considered. This Court held that the Sales Tax Officer is not a Court within the meaning of that section. All the reasons set out in this judgment which Kapur J. delivered for the Court are applicable to the case of the Income-tax Officer and if the reasoning in that case is taken to be correct, as it must be, ;the Income-tax Officer also must be, held to be not a court-unless any different conclusion is. justified from the provisions of section 37(4) of the Act. It will not be out of place to mention here what them Constitution Bench of this Court said in Jaswant Sugar Mills v. Lakshmi Chand(2) as regards the nature of the functions of Income-tax Officers. The question for the court's decision in that case was whether a Conciliation Officer under clause 29 of the Government Order under ss.3 and 8 of the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act was a \"Tribunal\" within the meaning of article 136 of the Constitution and the Court held that it was not such a tribunal. As illustrations of other authorities whose primary function is administrative even though they have the duty to act judicially, Shah J. speaking for the Court said :- \"The duty to act judicially imposed upon an authority by statute does not necessarily clothe the authority with the judicial power of the State. Even administrative or executive authorities are often by virtue of their constitution, required to act judicially in dealing with question affecting the rights of citizens. Boards of Revenue, Customs Authorities, Motor Vehicles Authorities, Income-tax and Sales Tax Officers are illustrations prima facie of such administrative authorities, who though under a duty to act judicially, either by the express provisions of the statutes constituting them or by the rules framed thereunder or by the implication either of the statutes or the powers conferred upon them are (1) [1963] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 242. (2) [1963] 2 S.C.R. 850. still not delegates of the judicial power of the State. Their primary function is administrative and not judicial.\" It is true that the question whether an Income-tax Officer was a court or a tribunal was not directly for decision in jaswant Sugar Mills' case(1). It is clear however that as a part of the reasoning which the court applied for coming to the conclusion that the Conciliation Officer is not a Tribunal this Court was of opinion that an Income-tax Officer is also not a \"Tribunal\". Obviously, if it is not even a Tribunal it cannot be a court. It is not seriously disputed by Mr. Desai who appeared before us for the respondent that looking at the functions of an Income-tax Officer it is not possible to say that the Income-tax Officer is a court specially after this Court's decision in Jagannath Prasad's case(',) mentioned above. His main contention is that even though the Income-tax Officer was not originally a court within the meaning of s. 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the deeming provision in section 37(4) has made him a court. Section 37(4) runs thus :- \"Any proceeding before any authority referred to in this section shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of ss. 193 and 228, and for the purposes of section 196 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).\" The authorities mentioned in the section are the Income-tax Officer, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the Appellate Tribunal. The direct effect of subsection 4 of s. 37 therefore is that proceedings before an Income-tax Officer \"shall be deemed to be a judicial proceedings within the meaning of section 193 and section 228 and for the purposes of s. 196 of the Indian Penal Code. As we read the section it at once leaps to the eye that there is no mention in this of s. 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In introducing this deeming provision in 1956 (1) [1963] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 242. (2) [1963] 2 S.C.R. 850.Parliament did not think it necessary to extend the deeming provision for the purpose of section 195. If Parliament intended this provision to produce the consequence that the authori- ties in the section should be deemed to be a court within the meaning of section 195 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it is reasonable to expect that Parliament would have added the words \"and shall be deemed to be a court within the meaning of section 195 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure\", or \"shall be deemed to be a court for the purpose of s.195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure\" or some similar Phraseology. The omission to use any such words is all the more remarkable when we notice that on several occasions before 1956 Parliament had in expressing an intention that a particular authority should be a court for the purpose of s. 195 added express words to give effect to that intention. Thus, in the Payment of Wages Act, which was enacted in 1936, section 18 after stating that every authority appointed under sub-section (1) of section 15 shall have all the powers of a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure for certain purposes, proceeded to say that \"every such authority shall be deemed to be a civil court for the purposes of section 195 and Chapter XXXV of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898.\" Again, in section 23 of the Workmen's Compensation Act which confers on the Commissioner for workmen's Compensation all the powers of a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 the legislature added in 1929 the following words:-\"and the Commissioner shall be deemed to be a civil court for all the purposes of section 195 and of Chapter XXXV of,the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898\". It is worth noticing also that in several other statutes parliament after stating that certain proceeding shall be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of section 193 and section 228 of the Indian Penal Code proceeded to say that for certain purposes it shall also be deemed to be a court. The Evacuee property Act of 1950 after stating that the enquiry by the custodian shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of section 193 and section 228 of the Indian Penal Code, goes on to say \"and the Custodian shall be deemed to be a court within the meaning of ss. 480 and 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898\". Another instance of similarlegislation is to be found in section 17 of the Evacuee Interest (Separation) Act, 195 1, which after stating that any proceeding before the competent officer or the appellate officer shall be judicial proceeding within the meaning of section 193 and section 228 of the Indian Penal Code adds \"and the competent Officer or the appellate officer shall be deemed to be a civil court within the meaning of section 480 and section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898\". The Displaced Persons' (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act, 1954 uses exactly similar words in section 26. That section first confers on every officer appointed under the Act the same powers in respect of certain specified matter,-, for the purpose of making any enquiry or hearing any appeal under the Act as are vested in a Civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure and then proceeds thus \"any proceeding before any such officer shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of section 193 and section 228 of the Indian Penal Code and every such Officer shall be deemed to be a civil court within the meaning of section 480 and 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898.\" Similarly, the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 after providing in sub-section (3) of section 11 that every enquiry or investigation by a Board, Court, Labour Court. Tribunal or National Tribunal, shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of section 193 and section 228 of the Indian Penal Code adds in sub-s. (8) of the same section the provision that \"every Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal shall be deemed to be a civil court for the purposes of section 480 and section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1892.\" This sub-section was added in 1950. In clear contrast with these are the statutes which after saying that certain proceedings shall be judicial proceeding refrain from adding that the authority will be deemed to be a court. One such statute is the Sea Customs Act, which in section 171A(4) lays down that every enquiry under that section shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of section 193 and section 228 of the Indian Penal Code and stops there. A somewhat similar provision, though in different phraseology, appears in section 51 of the Administra- tor-General's Act, (111 of 1913) which runs thus:134-159 S.C.-46 \"Whoever, during any examination authorised by this Act, makes upon oath a statement which is false and which he either knows or believes to be false or does not believe to be true, shall be deemed to have intentionally given false evidence in a stage of a judicial proceeding.\" The learned Solicitor-General, who appealed before us on behalf of the appellant, strongly urged that if the inten- tion of the legislature had ever been that the Income-tax Officer or other authorities mentioned in section 37 should be deemed to be a court for the purpose of section 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure it would have taken care to express that intention in clear phraseology. In any case, argues learned counsel, when in 1956 the old section 37 was wholly recast the Parliament which at least then had before it a well established pattern of legislative forms in the numerous statutes mentioned above. for expressing an intention that an authority shall be deemed to be a court for the purpose of section 195 or any other provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure, there could be no conceivable reason for the failure to follow that pattern. In our opinion, there is considerable force in this argument. On behalf of the accused-respondent Mr. Desai suggets that the words actually used, viz., \"that proceeding before the authority shall be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of section 193 and section 228 of the Indian Penal Code\" were by themselves sufficient to give effect to an intention that authority shall also be deemed to be a court within the meaning of section 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure According to the learned Counsel, a judicial proceeding with. in the meaning of section 193 of the Indian Penal Code can only be before a court. For this proposition we can find no support either in principle or authority. It seems clear to us on the contrary ;that proceedings before tribunals which are quasi judicial and not a court may well be considered to be judicial proceedings within the meaning of section 193 of the Indian Penal Code. Though the words \"judicial proceeding\" have been used in numerous sections of the IndianPenal Code, it has not defined the words, though the words court of justice\" as also the words \"a judge\" have been de- fined. The Code of Criminal Procedure in which also the phrase \"judicial proceeding\" occurs in several sections has ,defined it in section 4(m) thus: \"Judicial proceeding includes any proceeding in the course of which evidence is or may be legally taken on oath\". This definition of judicial pro- ceeding was included in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, from the very beginning. The fact that for all these years since 1898 Parliament has not thought fit to give any definition of the words \"judicial proceeding\" in the Indian Penal Code is some justification for thinking that the words \"judicial proceeding\" in the Indian Penal Code may reason- ably be held to have the same meaning as in the Code of Criminal Procedure. In other words, it would be reasonable to think that in the Indian Penal Code also the word \"judicial proceeding\" has been used to include \"any pro- ceeding in the course of which evidence is or may be legally taken on oath.\" That would bring within the meaning of the words \"judicial proceeding before many quasi-judicial authorities which are not courts, e.g., a ,Customs Officer or a Sales Tax Officer. It is unnecessary for our present purpose to attempt an exact definition of the words \"judicial proceeding\" as used in section 193 or in any other section of the Indian Penal Code. Even without any such definition however it appears clear that the phrase \"judicial proceeding' is wide enough to include not only proceedings before courts but proceedings before certain other tribunals. It is pertinent to point out that if a proceeding before any other authority except a court could not be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of section 193 of the Indian Penal Code, it would not have been -necessary for Parliament in the Evacuee Property Act, 1950, in the Evacuee Interest (Separation) Act, 1950, and in the Displaced Persons' (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act, 1954, to add, after laying down that the proceedings before certain authorities shall be judicial proceedings within the meaning of section 193 and section 228 of the Indian Penal Code the further words, that \"the authority shall be, deemed to be a civil court\" for certain purposes of the Code of CriminalProcedure. It is especially interesting to note in this connection the provisions of section 11(3) and section 11(8) of the Industrial Disputes Act to which we have already referred. Under section 11(3) as originally enacted every enquiry or investigation by a Board, Court or Tribunal shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of section 193 and section 228 of the Indian Penal Code. When Parliament added to this section sub-section (8) what was enacted was that every tribunal shall be deemed to be a civil court for the purpose of section 480 and section 482, Criminal Procedure Code, 1898. After the amendment by the Act 36 of 1956 the concluding portion of section 11 (3) ran thus :-\"Every enquiry or investigation by a Board, Court, Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of section 193 and section 228 of the Indian Penal Code.\" The same Act substituted in section 8 the words \"Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal\" for the words \"Tribunal\". In spite of the fact however that every enquiry or investigation by a Board has to be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of section 193 and section 228 of the Indian Penal Code Parliament refrained from saying that a Board shall also be deemed to be a civil court for the purpose of section 480 and section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This emphasises the fact that the legislature did not think that the necessary effect of legislating that a proceeding before an authority shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of section 193 and section 228 of the Indian Penal Code would be that authority shall also be deemed to be a court. To say now that the legislature in providing in section 37(4) of the Indian Income-tax Act that a proceeding before the specified authorities shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of section 193 and section 228 of the Indian Penal Code, intended also to say that such authority shall be deemed to be a court within the meaning of section 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure would be to impute to the legislature an intention of which it itself had no knowledge. Learned counsel for the accused-respondent then drew our attention to the use of the words \"judicial proceeding\" in section 476 and section 479A of the Code of Criminal Procedure and argued that in these sections the words \"judicial pro- ceeding\" have been used as equivalent to proceeding in a court. That may well be so. Section 476 lays down proce- dure in cases mentioned in section 195(1)(b) and (c) of offences that appear to have been committed in or in relation to a proceeding in a court. It was quite correct therefore to refer to such proceeding in a later part of the section as judicial proceeding. Section 479A lays down the procedure in certain cases of offences of giving false evidence in civil, revenue or criminal courts and necessarily speaks of the proceeding before those courts as judicial proceeding. It is difficult to see how the use of the words \"judicial proceeding\" in these sections support the contention that \"judicial proceeding\" can only be a proceeding before a court. There can be no doubt that every proceeding before a court is a \"judicial proceeding\". It does not follow however that every judicial proceeding is a proceeding before a court. Mr. Desai drew a grim picture of what would happen if the authority a proceeding before which was deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of section 228 of the Indian Penal Code was not at the same time considered a court within the meaning of section 195. He rightly points out that one consequence will be that if any person offers any insult or causes any obstruction to a public servant when he is sitting in any such judicial proceeding and thus commits an offence under section 228 of the Indian Penal Code it will be possible for persons other than the public servants to institute a criminal case for such offence. This, says the learned counsel, would be a very undesirable thing. We fail to see why this should be considered to be undesirable. But assuming this is so, that is not to our mind a consideration which should compel us to give the words \"judicial proceeding\" a meaning which they do not bear. It may be mentioned here, as already stated, that under s. 171A(4) of the Sea Customs Act, 1874, every enquiry before a Custom Officer \"shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of section 193 and section 228 of theIndian Penal Code\". In spite of this, the Constitution Bench of this Court held in its recent decision in Indo- China Steam Navigation, Co. Ltd. v. The Additional Collector of customs(1) that a Customs Officer is not even a Tribunal. After discussig several previous decisions of this Court Gajendragadkar C.J., speaking for the Court observed thus:- \"The result therefore is that it is no longer open to doubt that the Customs Officer is not a court' or tribunal.\" It is difficult to see how if the presence of the words \"shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of section 193 and section 228 of the Indian Penal Code\" in s. 171A(4) have not the effect of making a Customs Officer a court or a tribunal, the presence of similar words in s. 37(4) in the Indian Income-tax Act, can have that effect. In our opinion, the words used in section 37(4) of the Income-tax Act furnish no reason to alter the legal position that is inescapable on a consideration of the functions of the Income-tax Officer that he is not a court within the meaning of section 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. We would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the order passed by the High Court and direct that the Presidency Magistrate, Bombay, should now dispose of the case in accordance with law. ORDER In accordance with the opinion of the majority, this appeal fails and is dismissed.

A. A. Peerbhoy, J. B. Dadachanji and Rajinder Narain for the appellant. Porus A. Mehta and P. G. Gokhale for the respondent.1954. May 6. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by GHULAM HASAN J.-The appellant was tried and convicted by the Special Judge, Warangal, for various offences under the Hyderabad Penal Code. These correspond to sections 302, 307, 347 and 384 of the Indian Penal Code, the sentences awarded under the first two sections respectively being death and life imprisonment, and separate sentences 'of two years' rigorous imprisonment under the latter two. The. two learned Judges of the High Court, who heard the appeal, differed, Manohar Pershad J. upholding the convictions, and the sentences and M. S. Ali Khan J. acquitting the appellant. The third learned Judge, A. Srinivasachari J., on reference which was Occasioned by the difference of opinion agreed with Manohar Pershad J. Leave to appeal to this Court was granted by the two agreeing Judges. The occurrence which led to the prosecution of the appellant took place on September 13,1948, which was the beginning of the first day of Police action in Hyderabad. The appellant, who was Reserve Inspector of Police stationed at Mahbubabad at the material time, according to the prosecution story, visited two villages Rajole and Korivi accompanied by a number of Razakars and the Police. He arrested Janaki Ramiah (Prosecution Witness 5) and Nerella Ramulu (Prosecution Witness 9) at Rajole and took them to Korivi. Outside this village in the waste land he spotted four men going to their fields and shot at them with his gun. The deceased Mura Muthiah and Somanaboyanna Muthandu (Prosecution Witness 2) were injured in the knee, while the other two Kotta Ramiah (Prosecution Witness 3) and Kancham Latchiah (Prosecution Witness 4) were uninjured. The latter two hid themselves behind the babul trees. Prosecution Witness 2 also ran away and hid himself in the bajra fields a few yards away but the deceased remained where he fell. The appellant searched for the three persons who had run away. He caught Prosecution Witness 3 and Prosecution Witness 4 and brought them to the spot where the deceased was lying but he could not trace Prosecution Witness 2. The appellant seeing that Mora Muthiah was not dead, shot him in the chest and killed him. The whole partyconsisting of Prosecution Witness 3, Prosecution Witness 4, Prosecution Witness 5 and Prosecution Witness 9 then went to Korivi village. The appellant stayed at the house of one Maikaldari in the village and spent the night there. Maikaldari and one Berda Agiah (Prosecution Witness 8) both asked the appellant why he had arrested Prosecution Witness 3 and Prosecution Witness 4, for they were not Congress men. Upon this the appellant released them. The prosecution story proceeds that the father (Prosecution Witness 1) of the deceased saw the appellant in the night of the 13th September and asked him why he had killed his son. The appellant without saying more advised him to cremate the dead body. P.W. I borrowed wood from the people and cremated the body. Four months later the appellant went and ,stayed at the Government bungalow Korivi, -sent for P.W. I and offered him Rupees 200 as hush-money for not disclosing the offence. The offer was refused. Prosecution Witness 3 and Prosecution Witness 4 who had been released told the father of Prosecution Witness 2 next morning that his son was lying injured in the bajra field. He went and had Prosecution Witness 2 removed to the hospital where his injuries were attended to. On the same morning the appellant, who had detained Prosecution Witness 5 and Prosecution Witness 9 in custody, asked them to pay Rupees 200 when they would be released. Prosecution Witness 5 went with a constable to the house of Prosecution Witness 6 and Prosecution Witness 7 and borrowed Rupees 100 from each of them. On this being paid he was released. Prosecution Witness 9 was unable to pay any money and he was let off. The defence was a denial of the offence. The appellant denied having zone to the village in question or having committed any of the offences attributed to him. He stated that he was posted at Mahbubabad in order to stop the subversive activities of the communists and that the witnesses being communists had falsely implicated him. He produced witnesses in defence. The First Information Report was lodged on April 14,1949. This delay was due to the disturbed conditions prevailing at the time and does not affect the truth of the story. The appellant was prosecuted and the charge sheet submitted against him on October 30, 1949. The charge was framed by a Munsiff Magistrate who committed the appellant to the Sessions. As already ,stated, the learned Special Judge convicted andsentenced the appellant and his convictions and sentences were upheld by a majority of two Judges. It has been argued by Mr. Peerbhoy, learned counsel on behalf of the appellant, that his client had no fair trial and has detailed a number of circumstances as supporting his contention. We think it unnecessary to deal with each and every one of these circumstances as in our opinion they do not affect the substance of the matter and are too trifling to justify the conclusion that the appellant suffered any prejudice or that any miscarriage of justice had resulted. We shall confine ourselves only to a few of them which need examination. It was complained that the appellant was not furnished with copies of the statements of prosecution Witnesses recorded by the Police and this hampered the appellant in cross-examining the witnesses with reference to their previous statements. It appears that the appellant filed an application through counsel on August 28, 1950, asking for copies of such statements under section 162 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The corresponding section of the Hyderabad Penal Code is 166 which is not the same as section 162. While under section 162 it is the duty of the Court to direct a copy of the statement of a witness recorded by the Police in the course of investigation to be furnished to the accused with a view to enable him to cross- examine such a witness with reference to his previous statement, no such duty is imposed by section 166 and the matter is left entirely to the discretion of the Court. This application was made for re-cross-examination of witnesses which obviously refers to the last stage of the prosecution evidence. The order passed on the application as translated is unintelligible and does not convey the real intention of the Court. The original which was shown to us, however, leaves no doubt whatever that the Court ordered that the case diaries and the statements were in Court and the appellant's counsel could look into them with a view to help him in the re-cross-examination of the witnesses but if the Court later felt the necessity of furnishing copies, the matter would be considered. No complaint was made before the Special Judge about any prejudice having been caused to theappellant by this order, nor was this point taken before the High Court. Had the appellant any legitimate ground for grievance on this score, he would no doubt have raised it before the High Court. We think, therefore, that there is no substance in this point. It was also contended that the prosecution should have produced the duty register of the appellant who was- a Government servant in order to put the matter beyond doubt whether,the accused had left the Headquarters on the crucial date. We do -.lot think that it was any part of the duty of the prosecution to produce such evidence, particularly in view of the fact that direct evidence of the offence was produced in the case. It appears, however, that the appellant himself summoned the Sub-Inspector of Police with the attendance register for 1358 Fasli, corresponding to October, 1948. The Deputy Superintendent of Police in his letter had stated that the entries for October were made in the register for 1357 Fasli and that register was destroyed during the Police action. The appellant's counsel inspected the register and on noticing that the entry for October did not find a place therein and had been made in the previous register for 1357 Fasli, which was destroyed during the Police action, he withdrew the witness. The appellant satisfied himself from the inspection of this register that the desired entries were not to be found. Since the register containing the material entries was destroyed, it was impossible for the prosecution to discharge the alleged burden of proving the entries in the duty register on the material date. It was also faintly contended that there was no evidence to show that Mura Muthiah had actually died. The father of the deceased gave evidence that the dead body of his son was cremated by him and in this he was supported by other witnesses. There is no force in this point. Upon the whole we are satisfied that the appellant has not been able to substantiate his contention that he did not have a fair trial. The next contention advanced by the appellant's learned counsel is that there was a misjoinder of594 charges, -that though the charges of murder and attempt to murder could be joined and tried together, the charges of extortion and wrongful confinement were distinct offences for which the appellant should have been charged and tried separately as required by the mandatory provisions of section 233 of the Code. The first two offences took place on September 13, 1948, in the night, while the act of extortion took place next morning on the 14th and the latter charge had nothing whatever to do with the offences committed on the previous night. Learned counsel contends that where, as here, there is disobedience to an express provision as to the mode of trial contained in section 233, the trial is wholly vitiated and the accused is not bound to show that the misjoinder has caused any prejudice to him. The contention is based on the case of Subramania Ayyar v. King-Emperor(1) showing that the misjoinder of distinct offences being prohibited by the express provision of the Code renders the trial illegal and does not amount to a mere irregularity curable by section 537. This was a case in which the accused was charged with 41 acts extending over a period of two years which was plainly against the provisions of section 234 which permitted trial only for three offences of the same kind if committed within a period of twelve months. The decision of Lord Halsbury, Lord Chancellor, in this case was distinguished in the case of Abdul Rahman v. The King-Emperor (1) by the Privy Council. That was a case of conviction on a charge of abetment of forgery in which the depositions of some witnesses were not read over to the witnesses but were handed over to them to read themselves. It was held that though the course pursued was in violation of the provisions of section 360, it was a mere irregularity within section 537 and that as no failure of justice had been occasioned, the trial was not vitiated. Both the above cases were referred to by the Privy Council in Babulal Chaukani v. King-Emperor(1).. The question in that case arose as to the true effect of section 239(d), which provides that persons who are (1) 28 I.A. 257. (2) 541.A. 96, (3) A.I.R. 1938 P.C. 130,accused of different offences committed in the course of the same transaction may be charged and tried together. The question was whether the correctness of the joinder which depends on the sameness of the transaction is to be determined by looking at the accusation or by looking at the result of the trial. It was held that the relevant point of time is the time of accusation and not that of the eventual result. The charges in this case were conspiracy to steal electricity and theft of electricity both under the Electricity Act and under the Penal Code. The Privy Council referred to the fact that the parties had treated an infringement of section 239(d) as an illegality vitiating the trial under the rule stated in Subramania Ayyar v. King Emperor(1) as contrasted with the result of irregularity as held in Abdul Rahman v. The King,, Emperor (2) . The Privy Council merely assumed it to be so without thinking it necessary to discuss the precise scope of the decision in Subramania's case, because in their view the question did not arise. Again in Pulukuri Kottaya and Others v. Emperor (3) the Privy Council treated a breach of the provisions of section 162 of the Code as a mere irregularity curable under section 537 and as no prejudice was caused in the particular circumstances of that case, the trial was held valid. Reference was made to Subramania Ayyar v. King-Emperor(1) as one dealing with the mode of trial in which no question of curing any irregularity arises but if there is some error or irregularity in the conduct of the trial, even though it may amount to a breach of one or more of the provisions of the Code, it was a mere irregularity and in support of this reference was made to Abdul Rahman v. The King-Emperor(1). Several decisions of the High Courts were referred to in course of the arguments with a view to showing what is the true state of the law in view of the Privy Council decisions referred to above but we do not think that that question arises in the present case. We are of opinion that the present is not a case under section 233 of the Code and it is, therefore, unnecessary to consider whether the violation of its provisions amounts to an illegality vitiating the trial altogether (1) 28 I.A. 257. (2) 54 I.A. 96. (3) A.I.R. 1947 P.C. 67.or it is a mere irregularity which can be condoned under section 537. Section 233 embodies the general law as to the joinder of charges and lays down a rule that for every distinct offence there should be a separate charge and every: such charge should be tried separately. There is no doubt that the object of section 233 is to save the accused from being embarrassed in his defence if distinct offences are lumped together in one charge or in separate charges and are tried together but the Legislature has engrafted certain exceptions upon this rule contained in sections 234, 235, 236 and 239. Having regard to the facts and the circumstances of this case, we are of opinion that the present case falls under section 235. It provides that if in one series of acts so connected together as to form the same transaction, more offences than one are committed by the same person, he may be charged with, and tried at one trial for, every such offence. The prosecution story as disclosed in the evidence clearly shows that the offence of extortion committed on the 14th September was one of a series of acts connected with the offence of murder and attempt to murder committed on the previous day in such a way as to form the same transaction. The prosecution case was that when the appellant accompanied by his party came, he caught hold of two persons (Prosecution Witness 5 and Prosecution Witness 9) at Rajole and proceeded to Korivi. He took them into custody without any rhyme or reason. Then outside the village seeing the deceased, Prosecution Witness 2, Prosecution Witness 3 and Prosecution Witness 4 he shot at them. The deceased fell down while the others ran away. He pursued them and brought two of them back to the spot where the deceased was lying but was yet alive. He shot him in the chest and killed him. Then he proceeded to the village itself where he stayed for the night. He released Prosecution Witness 3 and Prosecution Witness 4 on the intercession of certain persons but kept Prosecution Witness 5 and Prosecution Witness 9 in wrongful confinement and released them only next morning after extorting Rupees 200 from Prosecution Witness 5. These incidents related in the evidence leave no manner of doubt that from the moment the appellant started from the Police Station, he committed a series of acts involving killing, injuring people, unlawfully confining others andextorting money from one of them. We are satisfied that the series of acts attributed to the appellant constitute one transaction in which the two offences which are alleged to be distinct were committed. The case falls squarely within the purview of section 235 of the Code and we are, therefore, of opinion that such misjoinder was permitted by the exception. No question of contravention of any express provision of the Code such as section 233 arises and in the circumstances it is not necessary for us to consider how far the violation of any express provisions of the Code relating to the mode of a trial or otherwise constitutes an illegality which vitiates the trial as distinguished. from an irregularity which is curable under section 537. This conclusion in our opinion disposes of the contention about misjoinder of the charges. The fact that the offence of extortion was committed at a different place and at a different time does not any the less make the act as one committed in the course of the same transaction. Turning to the merits of the matter, we are not satisfied that any prejudice was caused to the appellant in fact. It is not possible to say that the Court being influenced by the evidence on the question of extortion was easily led into the error of believing the evidence on the question of murder. The witnesses on the point of extortion are Prosecution Witness 5 and Prosecution Witness 9. These are the two persons who were taken away from village Rajole and were wrongfully confined, Prosecution Witness 5 being released on payment of Rupees 200 and the other let off without payment. These two witnesses are also witnesses to the fact of murder, in addition to the other three witnesses, Prosecution Witness 2, Prosecution Witness 3 and Prosecution Witness 4. Prosecution Witness 5 was injured by the gun-shot but survived. The other two were scared on hearing the gun-shot and ran away taking protection under the babul tree. It is not possible to contend that the Sessions Judge having believed the evidence of extortion from Prosecution Witness 5 must have been persuaded into believing that the story of murder deposed to by him must be correct, for there is not only the evidence of Prosecution Witness 5, but three other inde- pendent witnesses. Lastly it was contended that the judgment of one of the agreeing Judges Manohar Pershad J. is purely mechanical and does not show that he has applied his mind to the facts of the case. No such complaint is made about the judgment of the other agreeing Judge Srinivasachari J. It is true that the learned Judge has made copious quotations verbatim from the evidence of the witnesses and his comment upon the evidence is not as full and detailed as might be expected but this practice of writing judgments in this way seems fairly general in Hyderabad though we cannot help saying that it is not to be commended. It is the obvious duty of the Court to give a summary of the evidence of material witnesses and to appraise the evidence with a view to arriving at the conclusion whether the testimony of the witness should-be believed. We do not think, however, that the criticism that the judgment is mechanical and does not show a proper appreciation of the evidence is well-founded. The prosecution evidence was believed by the trial Judge and the defence evidence to the effect that the deceased was killed by the Military and that the appellant was not present at the time of the occurrence was disbelieved. This finding was accepted by both the learned agreeing -Judges. This Court cannot interfere with the finding arrived at, on an appreciation of the evidence. We are satisfied that there is no good ground for disturbing the conviction of the appellant. The only question which remains for consideration is whether the sentence of death is the appropriate sentence in the present case. No doubt there are no special circumstances which justify the imposition of any other but the normal sentence for the offence of murder.We think, however, that where the two Judges of the High Court on appeal are divided in their opinion as to the guilt of the accused and the third Judge to whom reference is made agrees with one of them who is upholding the conviction and sentence, it seems to us desirable as a matter of convention though ,not as a matter of strict law that ordinarily the extreme penalty should not be imposed. We accordingly, while maintaining the conviction of the appellant, reduce his sentence to one of transportation for life. In other respects the appeal stands dismissed. All the sentences will run concurrently."}, "annotations": [{"result": [{"value": {"start": 0, "end": 67, "text": "CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal number 82 of 1953.", "labels": ["NONE"]}}, {"value": {"start": 68, "end": 409, "text": "Appeal under article 134(1)(c) of the Constitution of India from the Judgment and Order dated the 16th August, 1953, of the High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad in Criminal Appeal number 1557/6 of 1950, arising out of the Judgment and Order dated the 16th October, 1950, of the Court of Special Judge, Warangal, in Case number 28/2 of 1950.", "labels": ["NONE"]}}, {"value": {"start": 410, "end": 481, "text": "A.

APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal number 1929 of 1990. From the Judgment and Order dated 29.7.1988 of the Central Administrative Tribunal Madras in Transferred Appli- cation number 244 of 1987. Ambrish Kumar for the Appellant. Anil Dev Singh, R.B. Misra and Ms. Sushma Suri for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by AHMADI. J. Special leave granted. The workmen of the Ordinance Clothing Factory, Avadi, Madras are represented by the petitioner/appellant Union. The workers of the factory are divided into two categories, namely, (i) day workers and (ii) piece-rated workers. The day workers are paid wages in the time scale of Rupees 260-400 on the basis of their actual attendance whereas the piece- rated workers are paid on actual out-put or production calculated on the basis of time required for making the item by multiplying the same by the hourly rate worked out by dividing the mean of the time scale by monthly working hours e.g., Rupees 330 + 195 hours = Rupees 1.69 (Rupees 330 being the mean of the time scale of Rupees 260-400 and 195 hours being the total monthly hours). The appellant-Union contends that the daily normal working hours of the workmen are 8 during the week except on Saturdays when the working hours are 4-3/4 only. Thus the total working hours during the week comes to 44-3/4 hours. If the piece-rated workers are required to work beyond the aforesaid normal working hours they are entitled to overtime wages under section 59 of the Factories Act, 1948. That section, in so far as is relevant, reads as under: \"Section 59(1)'--Where a worker works in a factory for more than nine hours in any day or for more than fortyeight hours in any week, he shall, in respect of overtime work, be entitled to wages at the rate of twice his ordinary rate of wages.\" This sub-section postulates payment of extra wages at twice the ordinary rate of wages for those workers of the factory who are required to work for more than 9 hours in a day or for more than 48 hours in a week. The appellant-union filed a Writ Petition number 2356 of 1985 in theHigh Court of Madras praying for an appropriate writ or direction to the respondents to pay the piece-rated workers extra or overtime wages at the rate prescribed by section 59(1) if the total working hours of any workman exceeded 44-3/4 hours in a week. The appellant-union contended that the piece-rate system was introduced sometime in 1963 and since then the piece-rate workers were paid overtime wages accordingly for work done beyond the normal working hours but the same was abruptly discontinued from 1983; so much so that they were even denied the wage at the normal rate for work done beyond 44-3/4 hours and upto 48 hours, i.e, 3-1/4 hours. It is, however, admitted that if the workmen are required to work beyond 48 hours in a week, they are paid extra wages in accordance with section 59(1) of the Facto- ries Act. Thus the controversy is in respect of the rate at which piece-rate workers should be paid wages for the work put in between 44-3/4 and 48 hours in a week. The workers claim they are entitled to extra wages for these 3-V4 hours at double the normal rate in accordance with section 59(1) of the Factories Act. In support reliance is placed on the Ministry of Defence letter number F. 8(5)/56/D(Civ. II) dated 1st September, 1959 which inter alia provides that in all cases where overtime pay is admissible to civilian person- nel, both under the provisions of the Factories Act and Departmental Rules, the overtime pay should be calculated as under: (i) For work in excess of normal working hours and upto 9 hours on any day or 48 hours in a week, overtime will be paid at the rate prescribed in the departmental rules. For calculation of overtime pay under this item only basic pay and Dearness allowance shall be taken into account. (2) For work in excess of 9 hours on any day or 48 hours in a week overtime will be paid at the rates prescribed in the Factories Act. For calculating overtime pay under this item total pay including all allowances will be taken into account. By a subsequently communication dated 13th February, 1963 the Ministry clarified that having regard to the revision of piece work rates effected in the Ordinance Factories co- relating them to the monthly scales of pay sanctioned by the Ministry's letter dated 16th January, 1954, the distinction between High Paid and Low Paid piece workers stood abolished and keeping in mind the Ministry's letter dated 1st Septem- ber, 1959, the President was pleased to sanction the follow- ing methods of calculation and payment of overtime to piece-rate workers: (i) Piece workers under P & A Regulations Part I 1923. (a) No overtime will be admissible for working overtime in the day shift. But for the purposes of distribution of P.W. profits, the time wages element in respect of overtime upto 9 hours per day or 48 hours a week will be determined at the rate of P/200 per hours, where 'P' represents the monthly basic pay and dearness pay where admissible. (b) An extra 1/2 hour pay calculated at the hourly rate of 1/200 of the monthly basic pay or the monthly basic pay and dearness pay, where admissible, for every hour of systematic overtime worked on the night shifts in addition to their piece work earnings. (ii) Piece workers under the Factories Act For each hour of overtime in excess of 9 hours on any day or 48 hours in a week a piece worker will be 1/200 of the monthly basic pay plus 25% of basic pay plus twice all allowances. In other words, if 'P' represents the monthly basic pay and 'D' stands for all allowances such as dearness allowance, house rent allowance, compensatory (city) allow- ance, overtime for each hour will be P/200 + 1/4P/200 +2D/200. This order was directed to take effect from 1st March, 1954. Thereafter, by a corrigendum issued on 21st October, 1965, sub-paragraph (1) of the Ministry's letter of 1st September, 1959 was directed to be substituted with effect from 2nd July, 1965 by the following: \"1. For work in excess of normal working hours and upto 9 hours on any day or 48 hours in a week, overtime will be paid at the rate prescribed in the departmental rules. For calculating overtime pay under this item, basic pay, dear- ness allowance, special pay, personal pay, pension (to the extent taken into account for the fixation of pay) in the case of re-employed pensioner and city compensatory allow- ance shall be taken into account. House Rent Allowance, conveyance allowance, traveling and daily allowances, permanent travelling allowance, clothing allowance, uniform allowance, washing allowance and children education allow- ance shall not be included.\"But by a Circular number 1823/LB dated 2nd February, 1983 it was stated that orders had since been received from the Ordinance Factory Board 'to stop payment of Departmental Overtime when piece workers work beyond normal working hours and upto 9 hours a day or 48 hours a week'. It was further clarified that they would be entitled to piece work earnings only for the period they work extra hours. Thus the payment of departmental overtime for January, 1983 in February, 1983 was stopped. However, with regard to workmen of the Ordi- nance Factories and other industrial establishments under the Defence Ministry governed by the Factories Act, it was laid down by the communication dated 11th September, 1987 that such workmen shall be entitled to overtime allowance at time rate for work done in excess of prescribed hours and upto 48 hours a week, in accordance with Ministry's O.M. dated 25th June, 1983, but it was clarified that the time rate of wages will be calculated with reference to pay in the revised scale with effect from the date the worker has been brought on the revised scale introduced from 1st January, 1986. In the light of the above, the appellant-union con- tends that as the prescribed hours of work were 44-3/4 hours per week, the workmen were entitled to overtime wage or allowance for work done beyond 44-3/4 hours and upto 48 hours a week at double the ordinary rates, which has been wrongly and illegally discontinued. The case set up by the respondents is that the workers of the petitioner/appellant-union are mostly doing tailoring work, stitching uniforms, tents, parachutes, covers etc., in the Ordinance Clothing Factory, a Govt. of India Undertak- ing, and are paid wages on piece rate basis. It is submitted that while fixing the piece work rate the labour involved in the production of each article is analysed in detail and the basic time is determined to which 25% incentive is added and the wage is paid on the basis of time so calculated by taking the arithmatic mean of the scale to which the worker belongs and dividing the same by the figure 195 representing the number of standard hours for a month. Thus if a piece worker completes his job allotted to him he would earn his basic time wage plus an extra 25% as incentive. It is fur- ther stated that the payment of overtime wages for the work done beyond the normal working hours of 44-3/4 and upto 48 hours in a week is regulated by the Departmental Rules and for the period exceeding 48 hours in a week or 9 hours on a single day is regulated as per the requirements of the Factories Act. According to the respondents the Defence Ministry letter of 1st September, 1959 as amended by the corrigendum of 21st October, 1965 does not apply to piece workers but their case in regard to the grant of overtime payment is governed bythe Defence Ministry letter dated 13th February, 1983 as amended by the Corrigendum of 18th January, 1970. In fact the former letters apply to day workers who are paid wages on the basis of attendance. Thus according to the respondents piece workers are not entitled to overtime wages at double the rate for work done in excess of 44-3/4 hours upto 48 hours in a week because they are entitled to piece work profit in the form of earning which is included in their wage structure itself to compensate them for the extra working hours upto 48 hours in a week. Yet on account of a mistake such payment was made till December, 1982 but when it came to light the same was discontinued by the Circular letter dated 2nd February, 1983. This discontinuance was challenged in Writ Petition number 10095/83 in the Madras High Court which was repelled by Mohan, J. by his order dated 6th December, 1983. The appeal filed against the decision of Mohan, J. was still pending in the High Court when the proceedings giving rise to this appeal were initiated by this Union. Lastly it is pointed out that according to the terms of section 59 of the Factories Act, the question of payment of overtime at double the rate can arise any if the piece worker has worked for more than 9 hours per day or 48 hours per week and not to cases of the present type. The respondents, therefore, pray that the present appeal is not maintainable and deserves to be dismissed. In the rejoinder filed on behalf of the appellant-union it is contended that the 25% incentive is not to compensate for overtime work beyond 44-3/4 hours and upto 48 hours in a week but is a measure to provide for rest intervals, minor mechanical breakdowns, tools sharpening or grinding or hold-ups for want of raw-materials, etc., to arrive at the operational time for production of an item. The appellant, therefore, contends that the contention that the letters dated 1st September, 1959 and 12th October, 1969 applied only to the monthly-rated day workers is misconceived. This is apparent from the subsequent letter dated 13th February, 1963 as amended by the corrigendum of 18th January, 1970. Therefore, according to the appellants, the contention that piece-work profit is incorporated in the wage structure applicable to piece rated workers is not correct and clearly manifests that the discontinuance of overtime is based on a wrong understanding of the relevant orders. In support strong reliance is placed on this Court's decision in Union of India v.G.H. Kokil, [1984] Suppl. SCC 196. Lastly it is contended that the respondents were not justified in abrupt- ly discontinuing the grant of overtime wages on the pretext of a so-called 'mistake' and their action in so doing is clearly high-handed amounting to unfair labour practice not expected from a governmentalundertaking. It is also contended that the circular letter of 2nd February, 1983 is a document of doubtful origin and can not in any case override the prior orders contained in the letters of the Ministry of Defence earlier referred to. The appellants, therefore, contend that the impugned deci- sion needs to be set aside and the overtime payments which have been unilaterally and arbitrarily discontinued re- stored. From the above resume it is clear that the controversy is limited to the question of non-payment of overtime wages for work done beyond the normal hours of 44-3/4 hours and upto 48 hours in a week i.e., for 3-14 hours in a week. There is no dispute that the workers are paid overtime wages for work done in excess of 9 hours on any day or 48 hours in any week in accordance with section 59 of the Factories Act. This section does not provide for overtime wages for work done in excess of the normal working hours and upto 48 hours. In Kokil's case (supra) the point for consideration was whether the employees working in the factory of the Indian Security Press, Nasik, were entitled to overtime wages under section 59 of the Factories Act read with sec- tion 70 of the Bombay Shops & Establishments Act, 1948, for the work done beyond the normal working hours. According to them their normal working hours were 44 per week, they were required to work in excess thereof but they were paid over- time wages for the extra hours of work at the basic rates though they were entitled to overtime wages at double the normal rate. In that case three contentions were raised, viz., (i) since none of the respondents was a 'worker' under section 2(1) of the Factories Act, their case was not gov- erned by section 59 of the said Act read with section 70 of the Bombay Shops & Establishments Act; (ii) assuming the respondents were entitled to claim the benefit of section 59 read with section 70 as aforesaid even though none of them was a worker, section 59 became inapplicable by virtue of Rule 100 made under section 64 of the Factories Act; and (iii) since none of the respondents was a 'workman' under section 2(s) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, the application under section 33C(2) thereof was not maintain- able. This Court, on a true interpretation of section 70 of the Bombay Shops & Establishments Act, came to the conclu- sion that the non-obstante clause found therein made it clear that section 59 would apply and the same non-obstante caluse kept out the application of section 64 read with Rule 100. On the third question this Court confirmed the Labour Court's finding that the respondents were workmen under the Industrial Disputes Act. In this view of the matter this Court held that the employees were entitled to overtime wages under section 59 of the Factories Act. Now under the Presidential order of 1st September, 1959 overtime wage was payable 'for work in excess of normal working hours and upto 9 hours on any day or 48 hours in a week' at the rate prescribed in the departmental rules. By the subsequent Presidential order of 13th February, 1963 the method of calculation and payment of overtime wage to piece workers was outlined. Under these orders the day workers are allowed overtime wages for working beyond the normal working hours whereas piece workers are allowed piece work profits as may be earned by them for working beyond normal working hours and upto 48 hours in a week. This is clear from clause (i) of the letter dated 13th February, 1963. Even the Manual of Cost Accounting (1986) meant for Ordinance and Ordinance Equipment Factories indicates that in the case of piece workers no separate payment for overtime is permissible under the departmental rules for day shift workers but they are entitled to piece work earnings only. That is why in the earlier Writ Petition number 10095 of 1983 filed in the Madras High Court a contention was based on Article 14 of the Constitution that the management was guilty of discrimina- tion inasmuch as day workers of day shifts were entitled to overtime wages whereas piece workers were denied the same. The contention was turned down by Mohan, J. whose decision was challenged in appeal before the High Court which appeal has since been dismissed for default. It is indeed surpris- ing why another Writ Petition number 2356 of 1985 was filed in the same High Court, notwithstanding the pendency of the said appeal, which writ petition on transfer to the Central Administrative Tribunal came to be disposed of by the im- pugned judgment and order. In fact it is doubtful if this second Writ Petition would have been entertained in view of the earlier decision of Mohan, J. rendered several years back soon after the discontinuance of grant of overtime by the circular letter of 2nd February, 1983 merely because a different union was espousing the cause, since the cause was identical. The decision of this Court in Kokil's case is clearly distinguishable on facts. 1n that case there was no dispute that if section 59 of the Factories Act applied the workers were entitled to overtime wages for work done beyond the normal hours and upto 48 hours. That would naturally depend on the relevant service rules since section 59 stric- to sensu applies to cases of overtime work done beyond 9 hours a day or 48 hours a week. In the present case the grant of overtime wages for the period in excess of the normal working hours of 44-3/4 per week and upto 48 hours is governed by the relevant departmental rules and section 59(.1) of the Factories Act comes into play only if a piece worker has worked beyond 9 hours in a day or 48 hours in a week and not otherwise. Further, piece workers are denied overtime wage for these 3-1/4 hours of work in a week because this factor is taken care of in the calculation of the piece rate. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the ratio of Kokil's case has no application to the facts of the present case. For the above reasons we see no merit in this appeal. The appeal, therefore, fails and is dismissed. No order as to costs. Y.

B. Dadachanji, Rameshwar Nath and P. L. Vohra, for the respondent.1960. November 24. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by HIDAYATULLAH, J.-The Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay City 11, has filed this appeal with a certificate under section 66A(2) of the Income-tax Act, against the judgment and order of the High Court of Bombay dated September 20, 1957, in Income-tax Reference number 15 of 1957. The question referred to the High Court for its opinion by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal, Bombay was: \"Whether the assessee is entitled to a deduction of Rupees 1,350 and Rupees 18,000 from his total income of the previous year relevant to the assessment years, 1953-54, 1954-55?\" The assessee, Sitaldas Tirathdas of Bombay, has many sources of income, chief among them being property, stocks and shares, bank deposits and share in a firm known as Messrs. Sitaldas Tirathdas. He follows the financial year as his accounting year. For the assessment years 1953-54 and 1954- 55, his total income was respectively computed at Rupees 50,375 and Rupees 55,160. This computation was not disputed by him, but he sought to deduct therefrom a sum of Rupees 1,350 in the first assessment year and a sum of Rupees 18,000 in the second assessment year on the ground that under a decree he was required to pay these sums as maintenance to his wife, Bai Deviben and his children. The suit was filed in the Bombay High Court (Suit number 102 of 1951) for maintenance allowance, separate residence and marriage expenses for the daughters and for arrears of maintenance, etc. A decree by consent was passed on March 11, 1953, and maintenance allowance of Rupees 1,500 per month was decreed against him. For the account year ending March 31, 1953 only one payment was made, and deducting Rupees 150 per month as the rent for the flat occupied by his wife and children, the amount paid as maintenance under the decree came to Rupees 1,350. For the second year, the maintenance at Rupees 1,500 per month came to Rupees 18,000 which was claimed as a deduction.No charge on the property was created, and the matter does not fall to be considered under section 9(1)(iv) of the Income- tax Act. The assessee, however, claimed this deduction on the strength of a ruling of the Privy Council in Bejoy Singh Dudhuria v. Commissioner of Income-tax (1). This contention of the assesses was disallowed by the Income-tax Officer, whose decision was affirmed on appeal by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. On further appeal, the Tribunal observed: \"This is a case, pure and simple, where an assessee is compelled to apply a portion of his income for the maintenance of persons whom he is under a personal and legal obligation to maintain. The Income-tax Act does not permit of any deduction from the total income in such circumstances.\" The Tribunal mentioned in the statement of the case that counsel for the assessee put his contention in the following words: \"I claim a deduction of this amount from my total income because my real total income is whatever that is \" computed, which I do not dispute, less the maintenance amount paid under the decree.\" The assessee appears to have relied also upon a decision of the Lahore High Court in Diwan Kishen Kishore v. Commissioner of Income-tax(2). The Tribunal, however, referred the above question for the opinion of the High Court. The High Court followed two earlier decisions of the same Court reported in Seth Motilal Manekchand v. Commissioner of Income-tax (3) and Prince Khanderao Gaekwar v. Commissioner of Income-tax (4), and held that, as observed in those two cases, the test was the same, even though there was no specific charge upon property so long as there was an obligation upon the assessee to pay, which could be enforeed in a Court of law. In Bejoy Singh Dudhuria's case (1), there was a charge for maintenance created against the assessee, and the Privy Council had observed that the income must be deemed to have never reached that assessee, (1) (1933) 1 I.T.R. 135. (3) (1957) 31 I.T.R. 735. (2) (1933) 1 I.T.R. 143. (4) (1948) 16 I.T.R. 294.having been diverted to the maintenance-holders. In the judgment under appeal, it was held that the income to the extent of the decree must be taken to have been diverted to the wife and children, and never became income in the hands of the assessee. The Commissioner of Income-tax questions the correctness of this decision and also of the two earlier decisions of the Bombay High Court. We are of opinion that the contention raised by the Department is correct. Before we state the principle on which this and similar cases are to be decided, we may refer to certain rulings, which illustrate the aspects the problem takes. The leading case on the subject is the decision of the Judicial Committee in Bejoy Singh Dudhuria's case(1). There, the stepmother of the Raja had brought a suit for maintenance and a compromise decree was passed under which the stepmother was to be paid Rupees 1,100 per month, which amount was declared a charge upon the properties in the hands of the Raja, by the Court. The Raja sought to deduct this amount from his assessable income, which was disallowed by the High Court at Calcutta. On appeal to the Privy Council, Lord Macmillan observed as follows: \"But their Lordships do not agree -with the learned Chief Justice in his rejection of the view that the sums paid by the appellant to his step-mother were not 'income' of the appellant at all. This in their Lordships' opinion is the true view of the matter. When the Act by Section 3 subjects to charge 'all income' of an individual, it is what reaches the individual as income which it is intended to charge. In the present case the decree of the court by charging the appellant's whole resources with a specific payment to his step-mother has to that extent diverted his income from him and has directed it to his stepmother; to that extent what he receives for her is not his income. It is not a case of the application by the appellant of part of his income in a particular way, it is rather the allocation of a sum out of his revenue before it becomes income in his hands.\" (1) (1933) 1 I.T.R. 135. Another case of the Privy Council may well be seen in this connection. That case is reported in P. C. Mullick v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Bengal (1). There, a testator appointed the appellants as executors and directed them to pay Rupees 10,000 out of the income on the occasion of his addya sradh. The executors paid Rupees 5,537 for such expenses, and sought to deduct the amount from the assessable income. The Judicial Committee confirmed the decision of the Calcutta High Court disallowing the deduction, and observed that the payments were made out of the income of the estate coming to the hands of the executors and in pursuance of an obligation imposed upon them by the testator. It observed that it was not a case in which a portion of the income had been diverted by an over- riding title from the person who would have received it otherwise, and distinguished the case in Bejoy Singh Dudhuria's case (2). These cases have been diversely applied in India, but the facts of some of the cases bring out the distinction clearly. In Diwan Kishen Kishore v. Commissioner of Income- tax (3), there was an impartible estate governed by the law of primogeniture, and under the custom applicable to the family, an allowance was payable to the junior member. Under an award given by the Deputy Commissioner acting as arbitrator and according to the will of the father of the holder of the estate and the junior member, a sum of Rupees 7,200 per year was payable to the junior member. This amount was sought to be deducted on the ground that it was a necessary and obligatory payment, and that the assessable income must, therefore, be taken to be pro tanto diminished. It was held that the income never became a part of the income of the family or of the eldest member but was a kind of a charge on the estate. The allowance given to the junior member, it was held, in the case of an impartible estate was the separate property of the younger member upon which he could be assessed and the rule that an allowance given by the head of a Hindu coparcenary to its members by way of maintenance was liable to be assessed (1) (1938) 6 I.T.R. 206. (2) (1933) 1 I.T.R. 135. (3) (1933) 1 I.T.R. 143. as the income of the family, had no application. It was also observed that if the estate had been partible and partition could have taken place, the payment to the junior member out of the coparcenary funds would have stood on a different footing. In that case, the payment to the junior member was a kind of a charge which diverted a portion of the income from the assessee to the junior member in such a way that it could not be said that it became the income of the assessee. In Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay v. Makanji Lalji (1), it was stated that in computing the income of a Hindu undivided family monies paid to the widow of a deceased coparcener of the family as maintenance could not be deducted, even though the amount of maintenance had been decreed by the Court and had been made a charge on the properties belonging to the family. This case is open to serious doubt, because it falls within the rule stated in Bejoy Singh Dudhuria's case (2); and though the High Court distinguished the case of the Judicial Committee, it appears that it was distinguished on a ground not truly relevant, namely, that in Bejoy Singh Dudhuria's case (2) the AdvocateGeneral had abandoned the plea that the stepmother was still a member of the undivided Hindu family. It was also pointed out that this was a case of assessment as an individual and not an assessment of a Hindu undivided family. In Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay v. D. R. Naik (3), the assessee was the sole surviving member of a Hindu undivided family. There was a decree of Court by which the assessee was entitled to receive properties as a residuary legatee, subject, however, to certain payments of maintenance to widows. The widows continued to be members of the family. It was held that though section 9 of the Income-tax Act did not apply, the assessee's assessable income was only the balance left after payment of the maintenance charges. It appears from the facts of the case, however, that there was a charge for the maintenance (1) (1937) 5 I.T.R. 539. (2) (1933) 1 I.T.R. 135. (3) (1939) 7 I.T.R. 362. upon the properties of the assessee. This case also brings out correctly the principles laid down by the Judicial Committee that if there be an overriding obligation which creates a charge and diverts the income to some one else, a deduction can be made of the amounts so paid. The last case may be contrasted with the case reported in P. C. Mullick and D. C. Aich, In re(1). There, under a will certain payments had to be made to the beneficiaries. These payments were to be made gradually together with certain other annuities. It was held that the payments could only be made out of the income received by the executors and trustees from the property, and the sum was assessable to income-tax in the hands of the executors. It was pointed out that under the wilt it was stated that the amounts were to be paid \"out of the income of my property\", and thus, what had been charged was the income of the assessees, the executors. The case is in line with the decision of the Privy Council in P. C. Mullick v. Commissioner of Income- tax, Bengal(2). In Hira Lal, In re,(3) there was a joint Hindu family, and under two awards made by arbitrators which were made into a rule of the Court, certain maintenance allowances were payable to the widows. These payments were also made a charge upon the property. It was held that inasmuch as the payments were obligatory and subject to an overriding charge they must be excluded. Here too, the amount payable to the widows was diverted from the family to them by an overriding obligation in the nature of a charge, and the income could not be said to accrue to the joint Hindu family at all. In Prince Khanderao Gaekwar v. Commissioner of Income-tax (4), there was a family trust out of which two grandsons of the settlor had to be paid a portion of the income. It was provided that if their mother lived separately, then the trustees were to pay her Rupees 18,000 per year. The mother lived separately, and two deeds were executed by which the two grandsons agreed to pay Rupees 15,000 per year to the mother, (1) (1940) 8 I.T.R. 236. (3) (1945) 13 I.T.R. 512. (2) (1938) 6 I.T.R. 206. (4) (1948) 16 I.T.R. 294. and created a charge on the property. The sons having paid Rupees 6,000 in excess of their obligations, sought to deduct the amount from their assessable income, and it was allowed by the Bombay High Court, observing that though the payment was a voluntary payment, it was subject to a valid and legal charge which could be enforced in a Court of law and the amount was thus deductible under section 9(1)(iv). There is Do distinction between a charge created by a decree of Court and one created by agreement of parties, provided that by that charge the income from property can be said to be diverted so as to bring the matter within section 9(1)(iv) of the Act. The case was one of application of the particular section of the Act and not one of an obligation created by a money decree, whether income accrued or not. The case is, therefore, distinguishable from the present, and we need not consider whether in the special circumstances of that case it was correctly decided. In V. M. Raghavalu Naidu & Sons v. Commissioner of Income- tax (1), the assessees were the executors and trustees of a will, who were required to pay maintenance allowances to the mother and widow of the testator. The amount of these allowances was sought to be deducted, but the claim was disallowed. Satyanarayana Rao and Viswanatha Sastri, JJ. distinguished the case from that of the Privy Council in Bejoy Singh Dudhuria (2). Viswanatha Sastri, J. observed that the testator was under a personal obligation under the Hindu law to maintain his wife and mother, and if he had spent a portion of his income on such maintenance, he could not have deducted the amount from his assessable income, and that the position of the executor was no better. Satyanarayana Rao, J. added that the amount was not an allowance which was charged upon the estate by a decree of Court or otherwise and which the testator himself had no right or title to receive. The income which was received by the executors included the amount paid as maintenance, and a portion of it was thus applied in discharging the obligation. (1) (1950) 18 I.T.R. 787. (2) (1933) 1 I.T.R. 131.The last cited case is again of the Bombay High Court, which seems to have influenced the decision in the instant case. That is reported in Seth Motilal Manekchand v. Commissioner of Income-tax(1). In that case, there was a managing agency, which belonged to a Hindu joint family consisting of A, his son B and A's wife. A partition took place, and it was agreed that the managing agency should be divided, A and B taking a moiety each of the managing agency remuneration but each of them paying A's wife 2 as. 8 pies out of their respective 8 as. share in the managing agency remuneration. Chagla, C. J. and Tendolkar, J. held that under the deed of partition A and B had really intended that they were to receive only a portion of the managing agency commission and that the amount paid to A's wife was diverted before it became the income of A and B and could be deducted. The learned Judge observed at p. 741 as follows: \"We are inclined to accept the submission of Mr. Kolah that it does constitute a charge, but in our opinion, it is unnecessary to decide this question because this question can only have relevance and significance if we were considering a claim made for deduction under section 9(1)(iv) of the Income-tax Act where a claim is made in respect of immovable property where the immovable property is charged or mortgaged to pay a certain amount. It is sufficient for the purpose of this reference if we come to the conclusion that Bhagirathibai had a legal enforceable right against the partner in respect of her 2 annas and 8 pies share and that the partner was under a legal obligation to pay that amount.\" These are the cases which have considered the problem from various angles. Some of them appear to have applied the principle correctly and some, not. But we do Dot propose to examine the correctness of the decisions in the light of the facts in them. In our opinion, the true test is whether the amount sought to be deducted, in truth, never reaches the assessee as his income. Obligations, no doubt, there are in every case, but it is the nature of the obligation which is the (1) (1957) 31 I.T.R. 735. decisive fact. There is a difference between an amount which a person is obliged to apply out of his income and an amount which by the nature of the obligation cannot be said to be a part of the income of the assessee. Where by the obligation income is diverted before it reaches the assessee, it is deductible; but where the income is required to be applied to discharge an obligation after such income reaches the assessee, the same consequence, in law, does not follow. It is the first kind of payment which can truly be excused and not the second. The second payment is merely an obligation to pay another a portion of one's own income, which has been received and is since applied. The first is a case in which the income never reaches the assessee, who even if he were to collect it, does so, not as part of his income, but for and on behalf of the person to whom it is payable. In our opinion, the present case is one in which the wife and children of the assessee who continued to be members of the family received a portion of the income of the assessee, after the assessee had received the income as his own.The case is one of application of a portion of the income to discharge an obligation and not a case in which by an overriding charge the assessee became only a collector of another's income. The matter in the present case would have been different, if such an overriding charge had existed either upon the property or upon its income, which is not the case."}, "annotations": [{"result": [{"value": {"start": 0, "end": 57, "text": "CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Appeal number 528, of 1959.", "labels": ["NONE"]}}, {"value": {"start": 58, "end": 179, "text": "Appeal from the judgment and order dated September 20, 1957, of the former Bombay High Court in I.T.R. number 15 of 1957.", "labels": ["NONE"]}}, {"value": {"start": 180, "end": 227, "text": "Hardayal Hardy and D.

K. Ramamurthy and P. P. Singh for the Petitioners. M. C. Bhandare, Raju Ramalchandran, R. R. Garg, V. J. Francis and N.M. Popli for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by This writ petition involves the familiar rivalry between promotees and direct recruits. Normally a resolution of such a dispute these two well known groups of service employees would necessitate considereation of various decisions relating to the quota and rota rule and such other allied matters. We have been relieved of this exercise because We feel that the dispute in this case can be resolved on facts, unaided by precedents on such matters. The counsel on both sides advisedly, therefore, restrained themselves from citing the relevant authorities before us. 2. Now the facts: All the 39 petitioners are promotees to the post of Assistant in the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (for short 'the society') the 1st respondent herein. The second respondent is the Union of India and respondent numbers 3 to 31 are direct recruits to the same post. Respondent numbers 32 to 88 are also promotees and have been impleaded as proforma respondents. 3 The petitioner originally belonged to the service of the Central Secretariat, Government of India, Ministry of Agriculture. The Society was a part of that department till 1. 4. 1965 on which date the Government of India decided to re-organise theSociety into a fully autonomous organisation with its own secretariat. The petitioners opted to join the service in the Society on such re-organisation. Respondent numbers 3 to 31 were directly recruited after an open competitive test, held by the Society in 1967 and 1911.A seniority list was prepared by the Society in 1976 showing the relative positions of the promotees and the direct recruits. The provocation for filing the writ petition was the publishing of a second seniority list, by the Society by its Memorandum number 27 (5)/81-Estt. II dated 7.4.1981. This list brought changes in the earlier list and pushed down the promotees from the positions they occupied in that list. The prayer in the writ petition is to quash this seniority list on the ground that it violates Article 1 and 16 of the Constitution of India and to stay its implementation. 4. The Petitioners' case is that they came into the Society by virtue of the option exercised by them and that they are entitled to seniority on the basis of the length of their service from the date of option. According to them, recruitment rules, laying down the terms of service in the Society, were not avilable then and as such seniority had to be fixed on length of service. The case of the contesting respondents is that seniority has to be fixed not with reference to the date of the reorganisation of Society and the date of option exercised by the petitioners but from the date of their appointment on a regular basis. They seriously disputed the case of the petitioners that they were entitled to seniority from the date they exercised their option. According to them the petitioners have to establish that they were duly appointed in the service on a regular basis, when they exercised their option, to claim seniority on the strength of length of service from the date of their option. 5. We must confess that there was considerable confusion both on the side of the petitioners and on the side of the Society and the Government regarding the existence of rules, regulating the conditions of service in the Society. Things proceeded in the Society on the basis that there were no recruitment rules in existence till 1974, while the factual position is that rules were in existence from 1964. It was on this wrong aasumption the that seniority list was prepared on 2nd February, 1979. In that list, seniority was reckoned with reference to length of service. It was after realising that a mistake had been committed and that rules, in fact, existed that the impugned list was drawn up on 7th April, 1981. 6. The petitioners have given a comparative statement as Annexure-9, showing the manner in which the new list has worked to their detriment. This Annexure show. the relative potions of the promotees and the direct recruits in the 1976 list and in the 1981 list. To cite two or three examples; direct recruits who were placed at serial numbers 4, 20 & 83 in the 1976 list, have gone up as seria numbers 2, 10 and 22, respectively, in the 1981 list. While preparing the 1976 list, a deemed date of appointment in the grade was adopted to calculate the length of service. The petitioners, case is that the direct recurits never questioned their placement in this list and therefore cannot oppose with any justification the petitioners' request for quashing the impugned list. Though this submission ' is wholly not unfounded, the petitioners cannot succeed merely on the inaction on the part of the direct recruits but have to satisfy the Court of a right in them to entitle them to seniority from the date they opted and came into the Society's service. It is this aspect of the case that needs examination by us in this writ petition. 7. In this case we do not have the usual picture of great injustice glaring in the face, of promotees being eased out of their places by direct recruits after a long lapse of time. Here we are dealing with a small Society with a limited number of employees and the dispute relates to a short period from 1965 to 1973. The petitioners cannot, in this case, put forward either the case of a wholesale reduction of their places, legitimately due to them or the collapse of the quota and rota system as was the case in some of the decided cases. The short point here is as to when the petitioners were regular appointed in the grade of Assistants and as to whether the petitioners' rightful places have been robbed by the Society and the direct recruits by the impugned seniority list. 8. The petitioners were originally Upper Division Clerks with the Agricultural Department of Government of India. They came to Court with the definite plea that their seniority was fixed on the basis of the principles applicable to Government service in the absence of any rules framed by the society, regulating their service conditions. It is stated in the petition that they made representations to the authorities for laying down of clear principles to determine the inter-se seniority between them and the direct recruits and as a consequence, the Government of India issued a Memorandum dated 20th April, 1970, asking the Govern- ment employees to give their option by 30th April. 1970 andreiterating at the same time that the inter-se seniority of the ministerial staff under the reorganised Council would be fixed on the basis of the date of appointment made on a regular basis. It is significant to note that the petitioners have not produced a single of their appointment orders for this Court to be satisfied as to then they were appointed as Assistants on a regular basis while a specimen appointment order of direct recruits has been produced. Still the petitioners insist that the crucial date for determining the inter-se seniority is 1-4-1965, the date on which the Society was reorganised. We find it difficult to accept the contention that the length of service has to be reckoned from 1.4.1965 or from the respective dates when they entered the service of the Society on exercise of their option when the Memorandum, produced by them, has clearly stated that the inter-se seniority will be fixed on the basis of the date of appointment in the grade on the regular basis. We have looked into the Memorandum Annexure-4, dated 20th April, 1970. It clearly states that the date for exercise of option has been extended to 30th April' 1970 and that the principles determining the inter-se seniority of the ministerial staff in the reorganised Council was considered by the Society in consultation with the Ministries of Law and Home Affairs and Finance and that it was decided that the seniority of the ministerial staff in the reorganised Council would be fixed on the basis of \" date of appointment to the grade on a regular basis .\" This statement in the Memorandum which finds a place in paragraph 8 of the Writ Petition also shows, according to us, the hollowness of the contention of the petitioners that seniority has to be fixed with reference to the date on which option was exercised by them. 9. Direct recruitment to the post of Assistants in the Society was made by holding competitive examination in 1967 and 1971. Upper Division Clerks, like the petitioners who were working with the Agricultural Dept., Govt. Of India, could very well have appeared for this competitive examination and got themselves directly recruited as Assistants on successfully passing the competitive examination. We are told that some of the petitioners in fact, appeared for the competitive test without success. Though this statement made by the counsel for the respondents at the bar was not disputed by the petitioners' counsel, we do not propose to rely on it since it is not a matter on record. Those who were successful at the competitive examination and the interview were offered the posts of Assistant by regular appointment as per appointment order produced asAnnexure-5, issued by the Society, containing the terms of appointment. As already indicated, the petitioners have either by design or by oversight failed to make available to us their orders of appointment on a regular basis in the grade when they exercised option. It is against this background that the challenge to the 1981 list has to be considered. 10. If the petitioners can satisfy us that they had greater length of service in equivalent grade than the direct recruits, they are entitled to succeed. If they fail, the list has to stand despite the fact that the earlier list was not challenged by the direct recruits. We do not have on record anything to show when the petitioners were regularly appointed in the grade of Assistants. In the absence of this evidence, can the petitioners succeed ? As already stated the Society and the Union Government were originally under a misapprehension that no rules existed governing the service conditions in the Society. The petitioners have produced a Memorandum Annexure-3 dated 21st August, 1967 which throws considerable light on the dispute involved in the case. lt is stated therein that the Government of India have approved of the reorganisation of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research into an office wholly controlled and financed by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, with effect from a date to be appointed shortly. As a consequence of the above decision the various posts existing as Government posts in the said Secretariat, will be abolished with effect from the aforesaid date and corresponding number of posts in various cadres will be created as nongovernment posts under the Society. 11. Paragraph 2 of this Memorandum reads: \"The Indian Council of Agricultural Research has, however, agreed to take over such officers as belong to the C.S.S. (holding posts of Section Officer's grade and Grade IV only), C.S.S.S. and C.S.C.S., employed on date in the Department of Agriculture and its attached offices (including the Indian Council of Agricultural Research) as are willing to serve the Council. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research will, of course, select from amongst the persons opting for its service only the number of persons required by them, keeping in view the total number of existing posts in the various cadres borne on the Govern-_ ment side of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.\" Clause VI of Para 2 reads as follows: \"The inter-se seniority of the staff in Indian Council of Agricultural Research shall be determined in accordance with the rules to be framed for the purpose taking into account, among others, the principles governing the seniority under the Central Government.\" From the passages extracted above, it becomes clear that appointments are to be regularly made to various grades only with effect from a date to be appointed after 21st August, 1967, the date of the Memorandum, which means that the deemed date of appointment mentioned in the 1976 list cannot be relied upon by the petitioners to project a case of their length of service from that date. The petitioners placed strong reliance on the Memorandum,` Annexure-4 dated 20th April, 1970, and in particular to the following: It has also been decided that 1st April, 1965 shall constitute the crucial date for determining the inter-se seniority of the staff finally merging into the reorganised Council. Accordingly, a combined inter- se seniority list will be prepared for each grade of the persons on the basis of the above principle in accordance with the position obtaining in respect of each individual as on 1st April, 1965 and all regular vacancies arising in the Council with effect from 1st April, 1965 upto date, meant to be filled by promotion (including those which have been filled up on ad hoc basis) will be filled up on a regular basis from the 1? inter-se seniority list drawn up in the manner indicated above.\" 12. Relying on this, the petitioners attempt to contend that their seniority should start from the date they exercised option and that this is correctly reflected in 1976 list. This submission overlooks the fact that even at that time, there were rules in existence prescribing a ratio of 1: 1 between promotees and direct recruits. In addition to this, it has to be noted that here also, filling up of vacancies on a regular basis is emphasised. 13. The Petitioners cannot therefore seek support from this to press a case of seniority from the date of exercise their options or from the deemed date of appointment. Rights can accrue to them as members of the new service only from the date they are regularly appointed in the grade. The impugned list instead of continuing the mistake committed in the 1976 list, has only corrected the mistake. 14. We find from the records that the Union Government and the Society were originally in error in their assumption that no rules existed for regulating the service conditions in the Society. We have at page 91 as Annexure-6, rules relating to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research before its reorganisation. The said rules show that the posts of Assistants can be fill d up 50% by direct recruitment and 50% by promotions. In other words, for every promotee there should be a direct recruit also. As is seen in the Handbook for personnel officer, the relative seniority of direct recruits and promotees shall be determined according to the rotation of vacancies between direct recruits and promotees which shall be based on the quotas of vacancies reserved for direct recruitment and promotion respectively in the Recruitment Rules. 15. New recruitment rules for verious posts in the Society including Assistants with which we are concerned, came into force with effect from 1.9.1974. Under these rules, in the number of posts available for Assistants 50% was to be by way of promotion from amongst the U.D.Cs. having rendered at least 5 years approved service in the grade on the basis of seniority-cum-fitness subject to rejection of the unfit on the recommendations of the D.P.C. and 50% by direct recruitment on the basis of the results of competitive examination held by the ICAR. 16. This method of recruitment was to be with effect from 1.1.1976. The method of recruitment before this date is also indicated in these rules. It is provided in these rules that vacancies, arising between 29.8.1973 and 31.12.1975, will be filled wholly (100%) by promotion. This means that vacancies prior to 2.9.1973 will be filled up in accordance with the 1964 rules and vacancies between 29.8.1973 and 31.12.1975, will be filled by the promotees alone and thereafter in the ratio I :1. From these rules it is evidentthat the Society was conscious of the claims of the promotees and hence safeguarded their interests by providing 100% posts for them between 29.8.1973 and 31.12.1975. By doing so, justice was done to them in a great measure. The petitioners have no grievance that in preparing the 1981 list, which is impugned in this writ petition, a departure has been made to their detriment, without adhering to the quota provided in the rules. Their only grievance is that the earlier list was changed without taking into account the deemed dates of appointment. We have already indicated that in the absence of satisfactory proof of the date of appointment of the petitioners in the Grade as assistants in the Society, the petitioners cannot successfully urge before us a violation of Article 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.A look at the list prepared in accordance with the above rules, fortifies our conclusion that no great injustice was done to the promotees in the preparation of the list. As one goes through the list, one finds that the gap between the promotees and the direct recruits is of a very short duration and not wide as in other cases. It is true that direct recruitment was made first only in 1967. However, to world out the quota system an earlier date of appointment had to be given to the direct recruits. This could not be avoided. This according to us, has not done any great injustice to pursuade us to give relief to the petitioners. The dislocation was limited only to a period between 1965 to 1967 and 1967 to 1971 aod not to a fairly long period of time. E In our Judgment, therefore, the petitioners are not entitled to succeed. The writ petition fails and is dismissed. The parties are directed to bear their costs, N.V.K.

Appeal by Special Leave from the Judgment and Order dated the 12-1-1976 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Criminal . A. number 583/ 72 R.N. Sachthey and H.S. Marwah for the Appellant. Hardyal Hardy and S.K. Sabbarwal for Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SARKARIA, J.--This appeal by the State is directed against a judgment of the Punjab and Haryana High Court setting aside the conviction of the respondent herein in respect of offences under ss.5(2) read with s.5(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 and 161, Penal Code on the sole ground that the sanction for his prosecution had not been accorded by a competent authority. N.C. Tandon, respondent Was a civilian in the defence service in the rank of temporary Superintendent Building and Roads, Grade I. It was alleged that he had accepted illegal gratification of Rupees 300 from one Brij Bhushan Lal, Con- tractor on 11-3-1971 as a motive or reward for doing an official act. The Contractor was at the material time doing the construction of main sewers in Chandigarh Cantonment near Panchkula. The respondent's duty was to supervise that construction. The respondent, it is alleged, demanded the bribe as a reward for recording correct measurements. Brij Bhushan Lal did not, in fact, want to pay the gratifi- cation. He therefore informed the Special Police Establish- ment authorities who on 10-11-1971 trapped the accused and allegedly recovered the tainted money from his possession. The sanction for the prosecution of the accused was accorded by Brig. Naresh Prasad, Chief Engineer, North Western Zone, Chandigarh on 24-6-1971. The Special Judge, Ambala tried and convicted the accused on the aforesaid charges and sentenced him to one year's rigorous imprison- ment and a fine of Rupees 1,000. Tandon appealed to the High Court. The appeal was heard by a learned Single Judge who held that on 24-6-1971, when Brig. Naresh Prasad Chief Engineer, North Western Zone passed the order of sanction for prosecution, he had under the relevant Rules, no plenary or delegated power to appoint to a post in Class III Service and that such a power was delegated to Chief Engineers of Zones for the first time on 14-1-1972. The learned Judge noted that the authority competent to appoint the accused-respondent on 24-6-71, was the Chief Engineer Western Command, Simla, and not the Zonal Chief Engineer. He therefore concluded that the sanction for prosecution of the accused had not been given by the compe- tent authority. On this short ground, the High Court al- lowed Tandon's appeal, without going into the merits of the case. At the outset, we may notice the general principles which govern the sanction for prosecution in such cases. Sub-section(1) of section 6 of the Prevention of Corruption Act says: \"No court shall take cognizance of an offence punishable under section 161 (or sec. 164) or section 165 of the Indian Penal Code, or under sub-section (2) (or sub-section (3A) of section 5 of this Act, alleged to have been committed by a public servant, except with the previous sanction of the authorities enumerat- ed in clauses (a) (b) and (c) of that section.\" Sub-section (2) of the section provides: \"Where for any reason whatsoever any doubt arises whether the previous sanction as required under sub-section (1) should be given by the Central or State Government or any other authority, such sanction' shall be given by that Government or authority \"which would have been competent to remove the public servant from his office at the time when the Offence was alleged.to have been committed.\" (emphasis added) Thus the test as indicated in this sub-section, for judging the competency of the authority giving the sanction is, whether at the time of the alleged commission of the offence, it had the power to remove the public servant from his office. Another principle to be borne in mind is, that unless a different intention appears, the power to appoint to an office includes the power to dismiss or remove from that office (vide section 16, General Clauses Act). We may further clear the ground and have a short, swift look at the relevant statutory rules. It is common ground that the post of Superintendent, Grade I (B & R) which the accused was temporarily holding, is a post of Class Iii Services, and the members of this Service are governed by Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965 (for short, hereinafter called 1965 Rules). The 1965 Rules were promulgated on November 20, 1965. Rule 34 of the 1965 Rules repealed the earlier Rules of 1952 and any notification or orders issued thereunder \"in so far as they are inconsistent with (the 1965 Rules)\". One of the provisions of the 1952 Rules, which is relevant for our purpose, and which has substantially been repro- duced in the 1965 Rules, is Rule 10. It reads as under: \"10. All first appointments to Class I and Class II Services shall be made by the Govern- ment. All first appointments to Class III and Class IV services shall be made by the author- ities specified in column 3 of Schedule IV in respect of posts mentioned against them or by officers empowered in this behalf by such authorities.\" (emphasis added). schedule IV reffered to in the rule ran as follows: \"Schedule IV (Vide Rules, 10, 11, 12, 14 and 19). SI. Posts Appointing Auth- Authority em- number orities in respect powered to im- of Class III and pose penalties Class IV posts (i),(ii),(iv) (vide rule 10) and (v) of rule 13 for Class II officers (Vide r. 14) 1 to 7 . . . . . . .. . 8. Posts in lower for- E-in-C C. Es. of the mation under E-in-C's Commands. Branch X X X.\" The former Rule 10 as recast into Rule 9 of the 1965 Rules reads as below: \"9(1) All appointments to Central Civil Services (other than General Civil Service) Class II, Class. III and Class IV shall be made by the authorities specified in this behalf in the Schedule. Provided that in respect of Class III and Class IV Civilian Services, or civil- ian posts in the Defence Services appointments may be made by officers powered in this behalf by the aforesaid authorities. (emphasis added) (2) All appointments to the Central Civil Posts,Class II, Class III and Class IV includ- ed in the General Central Civil Service shall be made by the authorities specified in this behalf by a general or special order made, by the authorities specified in this behalf in the Schedule.\" It may be noted that both under the old Rule 10 and the Proviso to new Rule 9(1), the appointing authority is compe- tent to delegate the power of appointment in respect of Class III Service. Rule 13 enumerated these penalties which could be im- posed upon the servants subject to the Rules: (i) Censure. (ii) Withholding of increments or promotion. (iii) Reduction to a lower post or time-scale or to a lower stage in a time-scale. (iv) Recovery from pay of the whole or part of any pecuniary loss caused to Government by negligence or breach of orders (v) Suspension. (vi) Removal from the civil service of the Government, which does not disqualify from future employment. (Vii) Dismissal from the civil service of the Government which ordinarily disqualifies from future employment.

It provided :- \"14(1) Any of the penalties specified in rule 13 may be imposed on any person subject to these rules by the Government or by the appointing authority.

(b) in the case of members of Class III and IV services by the authority empowered in this behalf by the appointing authority. Explanation.--In this rule the expression \"appointing authority\" includes an officer empowered under Rule 10 to make first appoint- ments to Class III and Class IV Services.\" Rules 11 and 12 of the 1965 Rules correspond to Rules 13 and 14 of 1952 in all material aspects, excepting two, namely, (1) Suspension has been taken out of the category of penalties, and (2) the Explanation appended to Rule 14 has been omitted because in the 1965 Rules, the subject matter of that Explanation has been made a part of the definition of \"Appointing Authority\" given in Rule 2(a). The main submission of Mr. Sachthey learned Counsel for the appellant is that by an order communicated per letter, dated 27-4-1956, made under Rule 10 of the 1956 Rules, (.subsequently reiterated in letter dated 23-1-1963) the Engineer-in-Chief had empowered all Chief Engineers in Military Engineering Service to make first appointments, inter alia, to posts in Class III Service, and that the operation of the aforesaid order was preserved and contin- ued by the saving clause in Rule 34(1) of the 1965 Rules. On these premises, it is maintained, that the High Court was wrong in holding that the Chief Engineer of the North- Western Zone, Chandigarh. was not the 'appointing authority competent to remove the accused from service. As against this, Mr. Hardyal Hardy, learned Counsel for the respondent submits that the order, dated 27-4-56, ex- pressly delegates the power of making first appointments. only to the Chief Engineers of the three Commands, then in existence, and to the other authorities specified therein. It is pointed out that in 1956 when this order was made, there were no Zonal Chief Engineers which came into exist- ence on reorganization in December 1962, as a class apart, working under the orerail administrative control of the Chief Engineers of Commands. The point pressed into argu- ments is that a general delegation of the power in favour of Chief Engineers of Commands, as a class, cannot, by any reckoning, amount to a delegation in favour of the Zonal Chief Engineers, also, working under the control of the Chief Engineers of Commands. Mr. Hardy has further submitted that the letter dated 23-1-1963 has not been issued under the signature of the Engineer-in-Chief, nor can it, by any stretch of language, be construed as a delegation of the power of appointment under Rule 10. In the alternative, it is submitted the power delegated by the Engineer-in-Chief to the Chief Engineers was a qualified one inasmuch as no power was given to them to dismissor remove a Government servant of Class III Service. It is maintained that by the aforesaid letter, the Chief Engineers were empowered to impose only minor penalties other than that of dismissal and removal. It is urged, in view of this restricted delegation in the matter of inflicting. penalties, it cannot be said that on the principle underly- ing Sec. 16 of the General Clauses Act power of appointment will automatically include the power to remove the person appointed from his office. In reply, Mr. Sachthey has pointed out that the fetter placed on the power given to the Chief Engineers by the letter dated 27-4-56, in the matter of removal or dismissal of Class III servants, operates only in case of persons appointed by the Engineer-in-Chief, and not where he was appointed by the Chief Engineer of a Command. It is pointed out that in the instant case, the accused was appointed not by E-in-C but by the Chief Engineer, Western Command, Simla. The main question that falls to be considered is whether the E-in-C's order communicated through letter, dated 27-4-1956, can be construed as a valid delegation of the power of appointment tO posts in Class III Service to Zonal Chief Engineers, which came into existence on re- organization in December, 1962 ? The material part of this letter reads as under: \"TO The Chief Engineer, Southern Command, Poona Eastern Command, Lucknow Western Command, Simla X X X Subject: Civilians in DefenCe Services (Classification, Control and Appeal Rules, 1962). With reference to Rule 10 of the Civilians in Defence Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1962, I hereby authorise the authorities mentioned hereunder to make first appointments to Class III and IV Services to the extent indicated below: Authority Posts (a) Chief Engineers . . . . . All posts with the excepetion of per- (b) CWO, NDES . . . . . manent appointments to the following categories: (i) Superintendent, B/R Grade I. * * * 2. Under Rule 14(b) of CDS (CC&A) Rules, 1952 the under- mentioned authorities are empowered to impose penalties referred to in Rule 13 ibid, to the extent indicated below :- (a) Chief Engineers and Penalties at (i), (ii), (iv) and (v) of Rule 13 on Class III employees in respect of whom E-in-C is the appoint- ing authority,\" A perusal of this letter will show that it is (among others) addressed to the Chief Engineers, Southern Command, Eastern Command, Lucknow, and Western Command, Simla. On the date of this letter there were only three Commands; two commands were created subsequently. There were no Zones or Zonal Chief Engineers at that time. Therefore, the Chief Engineers to whom the powers have been delegated under this letter could only be the Chief Engineers of the Commands, as a class. Since the delegation has been to the Chief Engi- neers of the Commands, as a class, it will cover the Chief Engineers of these Commands, also, which were subsequently created. But, the question is will it take in Chief Engi- neer of Zones and amount to a delegation of power in their favour, too, on their creation six years later in 1962 ? Answer to this question will depend on whether the Chief Engineers of Zones belong to the same class holding the same rank and exercising same administrative powers and control as the Chief Engineers of Commands ? At the final hearing, we had asked Shri Sachthey, to make available to us the official order, regulations and like material throwing light on this aspect of the problem-From the material furnished by him, it appears that the decision to reorganize the Military Engineering Service was taken by the Government in December, 1962. Pursuant to that deci- sion, the Zones were created and Engineering Services in each Zone were placed under the charge of a Chief Engineer, of that Zone. Chandigarh area was also made North-Western Zone, for this purpose. This reorganisation took effect from January 1, 1963. The main object of creation of Zonal Chief Engineers as stated in C-in-C's letter number 66161/II/E2A, dated 13-12- 1962, was to \"effect maximum possible decentralisation and thereby achieve speed and efficiency in the planning and execution of work services.\" As is apparent from the letter dated 22/26-12-1962 from the Engineer-in-Chief, the Zonal Chief Engineers have to work \"under the command and technical control of CEs Com- mands for the planning and execution of works.\" E-in-C's letter, number 6161/II/E2A, dated December 13, 1962 addressed to the Chief Engineers, Commands and others, also, makes it clear that under the re-organized set up, \"C.E. located at each Command H.Q. will be responsible for all engineer matters in the Command, administration and training of engineer troops and for the coordination of works. Under the Command and technical control of this Chief Engineer there will be number of CEs/CSWE...on zonal basis.\" These two letters unmistakably show that the zonal Chief Engineers are a class apart from the Chief Engineers of Com- mands. Although extensive financial powers have been dele- gated to the Zonal Chief Engineers, which are almost the same as that of the Chief Engineers of the Commands, the fact remains that they are under the overall administrative control of the Chief Engineer of the Commands concerned. In this view of the matter the scope of the delegation of the powers made under the letter dated 27-4-1956, must be construed as a delegation only to the Chief Engineers of Commands, as distinguished from the Chief Engineers of Zones which were then not even in embryo. This takes us to the letter dated January 23, 1963 from the Army H.Qrs., E-in-C's Branch. In the first place, this letter is not signed by the E-in-C. It appears to have been signed by some other person \"for E-in-Chief\"; secondly it does not purport to have been issued pursuant to any sepa- rately passed order of the E-in-C expressly delegating under Rule 10, the powers of appointment to posts in Class III Service. The opening sentence of this letter, no doubt, refers to HQ Letters number 66161/II-E2A, dated 8 Dec. 1962, para 4 and even number of 22 Dec. 1962, which we have already noticed. There is nothing in them which delegates the powers of appointment to any posts to the Zonal Chief Engi- neers. On the contrary, para 8 of this letter says \"All Class III and IV personnel will be provided by the Command CE and will continue to be borne on the strength of that Command for purposes of (a) All documentation (b) Temporary promotion (c) Permanency (d) Retrenchment and reversion (e) Pension-progress by the Unit but overall control by the Command CE.\" (Emphasis added) Mr. Sachthey has placed great stress on para 12 of this letter which says: \"The normal powers of Chief Engineer in all matters relating to appointments, punish- ments etc. vest with each Zonal Chief Engi- neer in accordance with this HQ letter number 27304/ELD(2) dated 27th April 1956. In exer- cising these powers it will be necessary to consult CE Command prior to recruitment and replacements.\" The argument advanced on behalf of the appellant is that the very authority that had issued the letter dated April 27, 1956 has construed it as delegating the powers of ap- pointment, punishment etc. to the Zonal CEs. also, and therefore, the Court should accept that interpretation. We are unable to accept this argument. We have already pointed out that this letter, dated 23-1-63, has not been issued under the signature of the same authority from which the order, dated 27-4-56, had emanated. It does not ex facie show that any order, apart from that dated 27-4-56, had been passed by the Engineer-in-Chief under Rule 10. For reasons given earlier, we have no hesitation in holding that the assumption made in Paragraph 12 of this letter ex- tracted above, to the effect that the Zonal Chief Engineers were vested with powers of appointments, punishments etc. in accordance with H.Q. letter dated 27 April 1956 was clearly incorrect, Perhaps, that was why on 14-1-1972, the necessity of making a proper order delegating such powers to Zonal Chief Engineers and others, under Rule 9 was felt by the Engineer-in-Chief.No other order of the Engineer-in-Chief made prior to 24-6-1971 under Rule 10 of 1952 Rules or under Rule 9(1) of the 1965 Rules delegating the power of appointment to posts in Class III Services, has been placed before us. We have therefore no alternative but to hold that on 24-6-1971, Brig. Naresh Prasad, Zonal Chief Engineer, North Western Zone, Chandigarh, was not competent to remove the accused-respondent, Tandon, from the post of Superintendent, B&R Grade I, Chandigarh and as such, the order sanctioning the prosecution of the respondent was bad in law. In view of this finding, we do not think it necessary to examine the alternative contention advanced by Shri Hardy. The case fails because there is no valid sanction, as re- quired by the law. Obviously, this does not preclude a fresh prosecution for the same offence--but it is a matter for the State, in the circumstances of the case, to consider whether prosecution should be launched against the respond- ent or not. We make this observation only to remove a possible misapprehension. In the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed. P.H.P.

Appeal by Special Leave from the Judgment and Order dated 14-2-77 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Criminal . Miscellaneous Petition number 6070 of 1976. D. Mookerjee and D. N. Mukherjee, for the Appellants. H. S. Marwah, for Respondent number 1 Anand Prakash and S. C. Patel, for Respondent number 2 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by FAZAL ALI, J.-This appeal by special leave involves an important question as to the interpretation, scope, ambit and connotation of the word \"interlocutory order\" as appearing In sub S. (2) of S. 397 ,of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973. For the purpose of brevity, we shall refer to the Code of Criminal Procedure-, 1898 as \"the 1898 Code,\", to the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 as amended in 1955 as \"the 1955 Amendment\" and to the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 as \"the 1973 Code\". The appeal arises in the following circumstances. An incident took place in village Amin on April 23, 1976 in the course of which three persons died and F.I.R. number 139 dated April 23, 1976 was filed at police station Butana, District Karnal at about 5-30 P.M. The F.I.R. mentioned a number of accused persons in including the appellants as having participated in the occurrence which resulted in the death of the deceased.The police, after holding investigations, submitted a charge-sheet against the other accused persons except the appellants against whom the police opined that no case at all was made out as no, weapon was recovered nor was there any clear evidence about the participation of the appellants. The police thus submitted its final report under section 173 of the 1973 Code insofar as the appellants were concerned. The report was placed before Mr. B. K. Gupta the Judicial Magistrate, 1st.Class, Karnal, who after perusing the same set the appellants at liberty after having accepted the report. It appears that the complainant filed a revision petition before the Additional Sessions Judge, Karnal against the order of the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Karnal releasing the appellants, but the same was dismissed on July 3, 1976. The informant filed a regular complaint before the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, on July 1, 1976 against all the 11 accused including the appellants. The, teamed Magistrate, after having examined the complainant and going through the record, dismissed the, complaint as he was satisfied that no case was made out against the appellants. Thereafter the complainant took up the matter in revision before the Sessions Judge, Karnal, who this time accepted the revision petition and remanded the case to the Judicial Magistrate for further enquiry. On November 15, 1976, the learned Judicial Magistrate, on receiving the order of the Sessions Judge, issued summons to the, appellants straightaway. The appellants then moved the High Court under section 482 and section 397 of the 1973 Code for quashing the order of the Judicial Magistrate mainly on the ground that the Magistrate had issued the summons in a mechanical manner without applying his judicial mind to the facts of the case. The High Court dismissed the petition in limine and refused to entertain it on the ground that as the order of, the Judicial Magistrate dated November 15, 1976 summoning the appellants was an interlocutory order, a revision to the High Court was barred by virtue of sub s. (2) of section 397 of the 1973 Code. The learned Judge further held that as the revision was barred, the Court could not take up the case under section 482 in order. to quash the very order of the Judicial Magistrate under section 397(1) of the 1973 Code. Otherwise the very object of section 397(2) would be defeated. While we fully agree with the view taken by the learned Judge that where a revision to the High Court against the order of the Subordinate Judge is expressly barred under sub-section (2) of S. 397 of the 1973 Code the inherent powers contained in section 482 would not be available to defeat the bar contained in section 397(2). Section 482 of the 1973 Code contains the inherent powers of the Court and does not confer any 'new powers but preserves the powers which the High Court already possessed. A harmonious construction of ss. 397 and 482 would lead to the irresistible conclusion that where a particular order is expressly barred under s. 397(2) and cannot be the subject of revision by the High Court, then to such a case the provisions of section 482 would not apply. It is well settled that the inherentpowers of the, Court can ordinarily be exercised when there is no express provision on the subject-matter. Where there is an express provision, barring a particular remedy, the Court cannot resort to the exercise of inherent powers. So far as the second plank of the view of the learned Judge that the order of the Judicial Magistrate in the instant case was' an interlocutory order is concerned, it is a matter which merits serious consideration. A history of the criminal legislation in India would manifestly reveal that so far as the Code of Criminal Procedure is concerned both in the 1898 Code and 1955 Amendment the widest possible powers of, revision had been given to the High Court under ss. 435 and 439 of those, Codes. The High Court could examine the propriety of any order-whether final or interlocutory-passed by any Subordinate Court in a criminal matter. No limitation and restriction on the powers of. the High Court were placed. But this Court as also the various High Courts in India, by a long course of decisions, confined the exercise of revisional powers only to cases where the impugned order suffered from any error of law or any legal infirmity causing injustice or prejudice to the accused or was manifestly foolish or perverse. These. restrictions were placed by the case law, merely as a rule of prudence rather than a rule of law and in suitable cases the High Courts had the undoubted power to interfere with the impugned order even on facts. Sections 435 and 439 being identical in the 1898 Code and 1955 Amendment insofar as they are relevant run, thus \"435(1) The High Court or any Sessions Judge or District Magistrate or any Sub-divisional Magistrate empowered by the State Government in this behalf, may call ,for and examine the record of any proceeding before any inferior Criminal Court situate within the local limits of its or his jurisdiction for the purpose of satisfying itself or himself as to the correctness, legality or propriety of any finding, sentence or order recorded or passed, and as to the regularity of any proceedings of such inferior Court.............. \"439.(1) In the case of any proceeding the record of which has been called for by itself or which has been reported for orders, or which otherwise comes to its knowledge, the High Court may, in its discretion, exercise any of the powers conferred on a Court of appeal by section 423, 426, 427 and 428 or on a Court by section 338, and may enhance the, sentence; and, when the Judges composing the Court of revision are equally divided in opinion, the case shall be disposed of in manner provided by section 429. (2) No order under this section shall be made to the prejudice of the, accused unless he has had an opportunity of being heard either personally or by pleader in his own defence.\"In fact the only rider that was put under S. 439 was that where the Court enhanced the sentence the accused had to be given an opportunity of. being heard. The concept of an interlocutory order qua the revisional jurisdiction of the High Court, therefore, was completely foreign to the earlier Code. Subsequently it appears that there had been large number of arrears and the High Courts were flooded with revisions of all kinds against interim or interlocutory orders which led to enormous delay in the disposal of cases and exploitation of the poor accused by the affluent prosecutors. Some times interlocutory orders caused harassment to the accused by unnecessarily protracting the trials. It was in the background of these facts that the Law Commission dwelt on this aspect of the matter and in the 14th and 41st Reports submitted by the Commission which formed the basis of the 1973 Code the said Commission suggested revolutionary changes to be made in the powers of the High Courts. The recommendations of the Commission were examined carefully by the Government, keeping in view, the following basic' considerations (i) an accused person should get a fair trial in accordance with the accepted principles of natural justice; (ii) every effort should be made to avoid delay in investigation and trial which is harmful not only to the individuals involved but also to society; and (iii) 'the procedure should not be complicated and should, to the utmost extent possible, ensure fair deal to the poorer sections of the community.\" This is clearly mentioned, in the Statement of Objects and Reasons accompanying the 1973 Code. Clause (d) of Paragraph 5 of the Statement of Objects and Reasons-runs thus : \"the, powers of revision against interlocutory orders are being takken away, as it has been found to be one of the main contributing factors in the delay of disposal of criminal cases Similarly, replying to the debate in the Lok Sabha on sub-clause (2) of Clause 397, Shri Ram Niwas Mirdha, the Minister concerned, observed as follows : \"It was stated before the Select Committee that a large number of appeals against interlocutory orders are filed with the result that the appeals got delayed considerably. Some of the more notorious cases concern big business persons. So, this new provision was also welcomed by most of the witnesses as well as the Select Committee........... This was a well-thought out measure so we do not want to delete it\". Thus it would appear that section 397(2) was incorporated in the 1973 Code with the avowed purpose of cutting out delays and ensuring that the accused persons got a fair trial without much delay and the procedure was not made complicated. Thus the paramount object in inserting this new provision of sub- section (2) of section 397 was to safeguard the interest of the accused. Let us now proceed to interpret the provisions of section 397 against the historical background of these facts. Sub- section (2) of section 397 of the 1973 Code may be extracted thus : \"The powers of revision conferred by Sub- section (1) shall not be exercised in relation to any interlocutory order passed ;in any appeal, inquiry, trial or other proceeding.\" The main question which falls for determination in this appeal is as to, the what is the connotation of the term \"interlocutory order\" as appearing in sub-section (2) of section 397 which bars any revision of such an order by the High Court. The term \"interlocutory order\" is a term of well-known legal significance and does not present any serious diffident. It has been used in various statutes including the Codeof Civil Procedure, Letters Patent of the High Courts and other like statutes. In Webster's New World Dictionary \"interlocutory\" has been defined as an order other than final decision. Decided cases have laid down that interlocutory orders to be appealable must be those which decide 'the rights and liabilities of the parties concerning a particular aspect. It seems to, us thatthe term \"interlocutory order\" in section 397(2) of the 1973 Code has beenused in a restricted sense and not in any broad or artistic sense.It merely denotes orders of a purely interim or temporary nature which do not decide or touch the important rights, or the liabilities of the parties. Any order which substantially affects the, right of the accused, or decides certain rights of the parties cannot be said to be an interlocutory order so as to bar a revision to the High Court against that order, because that would be against the very object which formed the basis for insertion of this particular provision in section 397 of the, 1973 Code. Thus, for instance, orders summoning witnesses, adjourning cases, passing orders for bail, calling for reports and such other steps in aid of the pending proceeding, may no doubt amount to interlocutory orders against which no revision would lie under section 397 (2) of the 1973 Code. But orders which are matters of moment and which affect or adjudicate the rights of the accused or a particular aspect of the trial cannot be said to be interlocutory order so as to be. outside the purview of the revisional jurisdiction of the High Court. In Central Bank of India v. Gokal Chand(1) this Court while describing the incidents of an interlocutory order, observed as follows \"In the context of section 38(1), the words \"every order of the Controller made under this Act\", though very wide, do not include interlocutory orders, which are. merely procedural (1) A.I.R. 1967 S.C. 799, 800. and do not affect the rights or liabilities of the parties. In a pending proceeding the Controller, may pass many interlocutory orders under ss. 36 and 37, such as orders regarding the summoning of witnesses, discovery, production and inspection of documents, issue of a commission for examination of witnesses, inspection of premises, fixing a date of hearing and the admissibility of a document or the relevancy of a question. All these interlocutory orders are steps taken towards the final adjudication and for assisting the parties in the prosecution of their case in the pending proceeding; they regulate the procedure only 'and do not affect any right or liability of the parties.\" The aforesaid decision clearly illustrates the nature and incidents of 'an interlocutory order and the incidents given by this Court constitute sufficient guidelines to interpret the connotation of the. word \"interlocutory order\" as appearing in sub-section (2) of section 397 of the 1973 Code. Similarly in a later case in Mohan Lal Magan Lal Thacker v. State of Gujarat(1) this Court pointed out that the finality of an order could not be judged by co-relating that order with the controversy in the complaint. The fact that the controversy still remained alive was irrelevant. In that case this Court held that even though it was an interlocutory order, the order was a final order. Similary in Baldevdas v. Filmistan Distributors (India) Pvt Ltd. (2) while interpreting the import of the words \"case decided\" appearing in S. 115 of the. Code of Civil Procedure, this Court observed as follows: \"A case may be said to be decided, if the Court adjudicates for the purposes of the suit some right or obligation of the parties in controversy;\" Apart from this it would appear that under the various provisions of the Letters Patent of the High Courts in India, an appeal lies to a Division Bench from an order passed by a Single Judge and some High Courts have held that even though the order may appear to be an interlocutory one where it does decide one of the aspect of the rights of the parties it is, appealable. For instance, an order of a Single Judge granting a temporary injunction was held by a Full Bench of Allahabad High Court in Standard Glass Beads Factory and ANR v. Shri Dhar & ORS (3) as not being an interlocutory order having decided some rights of the parties and was, therefore, appealable. To, the same, effect are the decisions of the Calcutta High Court in Union of India v. Khetra Mohan Banerjee(4), of the Lahore High Court in Gokal Chand v. Sanwal Das and others;(5) of the Delhi High Court (1) [1968] 2 S.C.R. 685. (2) A.I.R. [1970] S.C. 406. (3) A.I.R. [1960] All. 692. (4) A.I.R. [1960] Cal. 190. (5) A.I.R. [1920] Lah. 326. in Begum Aftab Zamani v. Shri Lal Chand Khanna(1) and of the Jammu & Kashmir High Court in Har Parshad Wali and ANR v. Naranjan Nath Matoo and others(2). Applying the aforesaid tests, let us now see whether the order impugned in the instant case can be said to be an interlocutory order as held by the High Court. In the first place, so far as the appellants are concerned, the police had submitted its final report against them and they were released by the Judicial Magistrate. A revision against that order to the Additional Sessions Judge preferred by the complainant had failed. Thus the appellants, by virtue of the order of the Judicial Magistrate as' affirmed by the Additional Sessions Judge ,acquired a valuable right of not being put on trial unless a proper order was made against them. Then came the complaint by respondent number 2 before the Judicial Magistrate which was also dismissed ,on merits. The Sessions Judge in revision, however, set aside the order dismissing the complaint and ordered further inquiry. The Magistrate on receiving the order of the Sessions Judge summoned the appellants straightaway which meant that the appellants were to, be put on trial. So long as the Judicial Magistrate had not passed this order, no proceedings were started against the appellants, nor were ,any such proceedings pending against them. It was only with the passing of the impugned order that the proceedings started and the question of the appellants being put up for trial arose for the first time. This was undoubtedly a valuable right which the appellants possessed and which was being denied to them by the impugned order. It cannot, therefore, be said that the appellants were not at all prejudiced, ,or that any right of theirs was not involved by the impugned order. It is difficult to hold that the impugned order summoning the appellants straightaway was merely an interlocutory order which could not be revised by the High Court under sub-ss. (1) and (2) of section 397 of the 1973 Code. The order of the Judicial Magistrate 'summoning the appellants in the circumstances of the present case, particularly having regard to what had preceded, was undoubtedly a matter of moment, and a valuable right of the appellants had been taken away by the Magistrate's passing an order prima facie in a mechanical fashion without applying his mind. We are, therefore, satisfied that the order impugned was one which was a matter of moment and which did involve a decision regarding the rights of the appellants. If the appellants were not summoned, then they could not have faced the trial at all, but by compelling the appellants to face a trial without proper application of mind cannot be held to be an interlocutory matter but one which decided a serious question as to the rights of the appellants to be put on trial. For these reasons, the order of the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Karnal dated November 15, 1976 cannot be said to be an interlocutory order and does not fall within the mischief of sub-section (2) of section 397 of the 1973 Code and is not covered by the same. That being the posi- (1) A.I.R. 1969 Delhi 85. (2) A.I.R. 1959 J. & K. 139.tion, a revision against this order was fully competent under S. 397(1) or under section 482 of the same Code, because the scope of both these sections in a matter of this kind is more or less the same. As we propose to remand this case to the High Court to decide the revision on merits, we refrain from making any observation regarding the merits of the case.

The High Court was concerned in the second Appeal with the lands in village Dhaipai and Chominda, and it held the gift having been without any power of alienation would fall under Section 14(2). The Exhibit D- I was the report of the Patwari in connection with the mutation proceedings and it said: \"Today Kehar Singh owner of Khewat came alongwith Narain Singh Lambardar and stated that he had on 14th April, 1947, made an oral gift of land-half of total land measuring 8 bighas Pukhta, 3 Biswas and 3 Biswani, which is 4 Bighas Pukhta, 12 Biswas and 1 Biswani as detailed in favour of his wife Mst. Basant Kaur, and given possession of the same. I had only one son who is dead and he had four sons and no other male issue. There is no certainty of life. She served me. Lambardar attests so the mutation is entered.\" On 30th July, 1947, the Assistant Collector made the following orders: \"In the gathering, Kehar Singh donor and Basant Kaur donee, identified by Kishan Singh Lambardar are present. The change of possession of this case is admitted and verified by the donor and the donee. Donor stated that he has got no son. I had got two wives. My grand sons, it is possible may not gift maintenance to my wife. With this view I make the gift. Gift is for maintenance. After gift there would be no powers of mortgage or sale. After the death of Basant Kaur Malkiat Singh, Amar Singh, Gurdeep Singh and Mohan Singh, children would be heirs. This gift is of 1/2 share or Khasra number 4658/2468 measuring 4 Bighas, 12 Biswas 1 Biswani, Khewat numbers 324 to 326, which is attested in favour of Mst. Basant Kaur donee.\" The High Court on interpretation of the Assistant Collector's report came into conclusion that Basant Kaur derived only a limited estate inasmuch as such a gift, according to the high Court, would fall directly under- section 14(2) of the Hindu Succession Act and as such the limited estate of Basant Kaur would not stand enlarged into an absolute estate. The challenge was to the gift made by Basant Kaur in favour of two step grand sons ignoring the other two. There is no doubt that Basant Kaur had the right of maintenance and the gift was explicitly in lieu of maintenance. As such we are of the view that it was not a case of her acquiring any new property by virtue of the gift but it was a case of her right of maintenance being given to her by way of a gift. It was a property acquired by gift in lieu of maintenance. This acquisition on 26th April, 1947 having-been prior to the Hindu Succession Act, we are of the view that she having acquired this property by way of gift in lieu of her antecedent right to maintenance, it would fall under sub-section (1) and not under sub-section (2) of section 14 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. In this view we are in consonance with the decisions in Bai Vijia (Dead) by Lrs. v. Thakorbhai Chelabhai & ORS , [1979] 3 SCR 291; Gulwant Kaur & ANR v. Mohinder Singh & ORS , [19871 3 SCC 674; Maharaja Pillai Lakshmi Ammal v. Maharaja Pillai Thillanayakom Pillai & ANR , [1988] 1 SCC 99 and Jaswant Kaur v. Major Harpal Singh, [1989] 3 SCC 572. In view of the facts and circumstances, we are of the view that the decisions of Mst. Karmi v. Amru & ORS , [ 1972] 4 SCC 86 and Kothi Satyanarayana v. Galla Sithayya & ORS , [ 1986] 4 SCC 760 are distinguishable on facts. In the result, the Judgment and decree of the High Court are set aside, this appeal is allowed and the suit is dismissed.

Appeal by special leave from the judgment and decree dated December 8, 1958 of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Second Appeal number 845 of 1953. Alladi Kuppuswami and R. Gopalakrishnan, for the appellants. N. C. Chatterjee, S.G. Patwardhan, S. Balakrishnan, R. Thiagarajan for N.S. Mani, for respondents numbers 4, 7 and 8.The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Mudholkar, J. In this appeal by special leave from a judg- ment of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh the question which arises for consideration is whether the interest of a partner in partnership assets comprising of movable as well as immovable property should be treated as movable or immovable property for the purposes of section 17(1) of the Registration 'Act, 1908. The question arises in this way. Members of two joint Hindu families, to whom we would refer for convenience as 'the Addanki family and the Bhaskara family, entered into partnership for the purpose of carrying on business of hulling rice, decorticating groundnuts etc. Each family had half share in that business. The capital of the partnership consisted, among other things, of some lands belonging to the families. During the course of the business of the partnership some more lands were acquired by the partnership. The plaintiffs who are two members of the Addanki family instituted a suit in the court of Subordinate Judge, Chittoor on March 4, 1949 for the following reliefs \"(a) for a declaration that the suit properties belong to the plaintiffs and defendants IO to 14 and defendants 1 to 9 equally for a division of the same into four equal shares, one share to be delivered to the plaintiffs or for a division of the same into two equal shares to be delivered to the plaintiffs and the defendants 10 to 14 jointly; (b) or in the alternative dissolving the partnership between the plaintiffs and defendants 10 to 14 on the one hand and defendants 1 to 9 on the other hand directing accounts to be taken; (c) directing the defendants 1 to 9 to render accounts of the income of the suit properties; (d) directing the defendants 1 to 9 to pay the costs of the suit to the plaintiffs; (e) and pass such further relief as may be deemed fit in the circumstances of the case. It may be mentioned that in their suit the plaintiffs made all the members of the Bhaskara family as defendants and also joined those members of the Addanki family who had not joined as plaintiffs. We are concerned here only with the defence of the members of the Bhaskara family. According to them the partnership was dissolved in the year 1936 and accounts were settled between the two families. In support of this plea they have relied upon a karar executed in favour of Bhaskara Gurappa Setty, who was presumably the karta of the Bhaskara family, by five members of the Addanki family, who presumably represented all the members of the Addanki family. Therefore, according to the Bhaskara defendants; the plaintiffs had no cause of action. Alternatively they contended that the suit was barred by time' In the view which we take it would not be necessary to consider the second defence raised by the Addanki family. The relevant portion of the karar reads thus : \"As disputes have arisen in our family regarding partition, it is not possible to carry on the business or to make investment in future. Moreover, you yourself have undertaken to discharge some of the debts payable by us in the coastal parts in connection with our private business. Therefore, from this day onwards we have closed the joint business. So, from this day onwards, we have given up (our) share in the machine etc., and in the business, and we have made over the same to you alone completely by way of adjustment. You yourself shall carry on the business without ourselves having anything to do with the profit and loss. Here for, you have given up to us the property forming our Venkatasubbayya's share which you have purchased and delivered possession of the same to us even previously. In case you want to execute and deliver a proper document in respect of the share which we have given up to you, we shall at your own expense, execute and deliver a document registered.\" This document on its face shows that the partnership business had come to an end and that the Addanki family had given up their share in the \"machine etc., in the business\" and had made it over to the Bhaskara family. It also recites the fact that the Addanki family had already received certain property which was purchased by the partnership presumably as that family's share in the partnership assets. The argument advanced by Mr. Alladi Kuppuswami is that since the partnership assets. included immovable property and the document records relinquishment by the members of the Addanki family of their interest in those assets, this document was compulsorily registerable under section 17(1)(c) of the Registration Act and that as it was not registered it is inadmissible in evidence to prove the dissolution of the partnership as well as the settlement of accounts. Direct cases upon this point of the courts in India are few but before we examine them it would be desirable to advert to the provisions of the Partnership Act itself bearing oh the interest of partners in partnership property. Section 14 provides that subject to contract between the partners the property of the firm includes all property originally brought into the stock of the firm or acquired.by the firm for the purposes and in the course of the business of the firm. Section 15 provides that such property shall ordinarily be held and used by the partners exclusively for the purposes of the business of the firm. Though that is so a firm has no legal ,existence under the Act and the partnership property will, therefore, be deemed to he held by the partners for the business of the part- nership. Section 29 deals with the rights of a transferee of a partner's interest and sub-section (1) provides that such a transferee will not have the same rights as the transferor partner but he would be entitled to receive the share of profits of his transferor and that he will be bound to accept the account of profits agreed to by the partners. Sub-section (2) provides that upon dissolution of the firm or upon a transferor-partner ceasing to be a partner the transferee would be entitled as against the remaining partners to receive the share of the assets of the firm to which his transferor was entitled and will also be entitled to an account as from the date of dissolution. Section 30 deals with the case of a minor admitted to the benefits of partnerships. Such minor is given a right to his share of the property of the firm and also a right to a share in the profits of the firm as may be agreed upon. But his share will be liable for the acts of the firm though he would not be personally liable for them. Sub-section (4) however, debars a minor from suing the partners for accounts or for his share of the property or profits of the firm save when severing his connection with the firm. It also provides that when he is severing his connection with the firm the court shall make a valuation of his share in the property of the firm. Sections 31 to 38 deal with incoming and outgoing partners. Some of the consequences of retirement of a partner are dealt with in sub-ss. (2) and (3) of section 32 while some others are dealt with in ss. 36 and 37. Under section 37 the outgoing partner or the estate of a deceased partner, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, would be, entitled to at the option of himself or his representatives to such share of profits made since he ceased to be a partner as may be attributable to the property of the firm or to interest at the rate of six per cent. per annum on the amount of his share in the property of the firm. The subject of dissolution of a firm and the consequences are dealt with in chapter VI, ss. 39 to 55. of these the one which is relevant for this discussion is section 48 which runs thus : \"In settling the accounts of a firm after dissolution the following rules shall, subject to agreement by the partners, be observed : (a) Losses, including deficiencies of capital, shall be paid first out of profits, next out of capital and, lastly, if necessary, by the partners individually in the proportions in which they were entitled to share profits. (b) The assets of the firm, including any sums contributed by the partners to make up deficiencies of capital, shall be applied in the following manner and order :- (i) in paying the debts of the firm to third parties: (ii) in paying to each partner rateably what is due to him from the firm for advances as distinguished from capital; (iii) in paying to each partner rateable what is due to him on account of capital; and (iv) the residue, if any, shall be divided among the partners in the proportions in which they were entitled to share profits.\" From a perusal of these provisions it would be abundantly clear that whatever may be the character of the property which is brought in by the partners when the partnership is formed or which may be acquired in the course of the business of the partnership it becomes the property of the firm and what a partner is entitled to is his share of profits, if any, accruing, to the partnership from the realisation of this property, and upon dissolution of the partnership to a share in the money representing the value of the property. No doubt, since a firm has no legal existence, the partnership property will vest in all the partners and in that sense every partner has an interest in the property of the partnership. During the subsistence of the partnership, however, no partner can deal with any portion of the property as his own. Nor can he assign his interest in a specific item of the partnership property to anyone. His right is to obtain such profits, if any, as fall to his share from time to time and upon the dissolution of the firm to a share in the assets of the firm which remain after satisfying the liabilities set out in clause (a) and sub-cls.. (i), (ii) and (iii) of cl.(b) of section 48. It has been stated in Lindley on Partnership, 12th ed. at p. 375 \"What is meant by the share of a partner is his proportion of the partnership assets after they have been ill realised and converted into money, and all the partner-ship debts and liabilities have' been paid and discharged. This it is, and this only which on the death of a partner passes to his representatives, or to a legatee of his share .......... and which on his, bankruptcy passes to his trustee.\" This statement of law is based upon a number of decisions of the English courts. One of these is Rodriguez v. Speyer Bros.(1) H where at p. 68 it has been observed (1) [1919] A.C. 59. \" When a debt due to a firm is got in no partner, has any definite share or interest in that debt; his right is merely to have the money so received applied, together with the other assets, in discharging the liabilities of the firm, and to receive his share of any surplus there may be when the liquidation has been completed.\" No doubt this decision was subsequent to the enactment of the English Partnership Act of 1890. Even in several earlier cases, as for instance, Darby v. Darby(1) the , same view has been expressed. That was a case where two Persons purchased lands on a joint speculation with their joint monies for the purpose of converting them into building plots and reselling them at a profit or loss. It was held by Kindersley V.C. that there was a conversion of the property purchased out and out and upon the death of one of the partners his share in the part of the unrealised estate passed to his personal representatives. After examining the earlier cases the learned Vice-Chancellor observed at p. 995 \"The result then of the authorities may be thus stated :-Lord Thurlow was of opinion that a special contract was necessary to convert the land into personalty : and Sir W. Grant followed that decision. Lord Eldon on more than one occasion strongly \"pressed his opinion that Lord Thurlow's decision was wrong. Sir J. Leach clearly decided in three cases that there was conversion out and out : and Sir L. Shadwell, in the last case before him, clearly decided in the same way. That is the state of the authorities. Now it appears to me that, irrespective of authority, and looking at the matter with reference to principles well established in this Court, if partners purchase land merely for the purpose of their trade, and pay for it out of the partnership property, that transaction makes the property personalty, and effects a conversion out and out.\" He then observed \" This principle is clearly laid down by Lord Eldon in Crawshav v. CollinS(2) and by Sir W. Grant in Featherstonhaugh v. Fenwick(3) and the right of each partner to insist on a sale of all the partnership property, which arises from what is implied in the contract of partnership, is just as stringent a special contract would be. If then this rule applies to ordinary stock-in-trade, why should it. (1) 61 E.R. 992. (2) 15 V6s. 218. (3) 17 Ves. 298. not apply to all kinds of partnership property ? suppose that partners, for the purpose of carrying on their business, purchase, out of the funds of the partnership, leasehold estate, or take a lease of land, paying the rent out of the partnership funds, can it be doubted that the same rule which applies to ordinary chattels- would apply to such leasehold property ? I do not think it was ever questioned that, on a dissolution, the right of each partner to have the partnership effects sold applies to leasehold property belonging to the partnership as much as to any other stock-in-trade. No one partner can insist on retaining his share unsold. Nor would it make any difference in whom the legal estate was vested, whether in one of the partners or in all; this Court would regulate the matter according to the equities. And Sir W. Grant so decided in Featherstonhaugh v. Fenwick.( )\" We have quoted extensively from this decision because of the argument that the decision in Rodriguez's case(2) would have been otherwise but for section 22 of the English Act. Adverting to this Lindley has said : \"From the principle that a share of a partner is nothing more than his proportion of the partnership assets after they have been turned into money and applied in liquidation of the partnership, whether its property consists of land or not, must, as between the real and personal representatives of a deceased partner, be deemed to be personal and not real estate, unless indeed such conversion is inconsistent with the agreement between the parties. Although the decisions upon this point were conflicting, the authorities which were in favour of the foregoing conclusion certainly preponderated over the others, and all doubt upon the point has been removed by the Partnership Act, 1890, which contains the following section : 22. Where land or any heritable interest therein has become partnership, property it shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be treated as between the. partners (including the representative of a deceased partner), and also as between the heirs of a deceased partner and his executors or administrators, as personal or movable and not real or heritable estate.\" Even in a still earlier case Foster v. Hale(3) a person :attempted to obtain an account of the profits of a colliery on the ground that it was partnership property and it was objected that (1) 17 ves. 298. (3) 5 Ves. 308. (2) [1919] A.C. 59.there was no signed writing, such as the Statute of Frauds required. Dealing with it the Lord Chancellor observed : \"That was not the question : it was whether there was a partnership. The subject being an agreement for land, the question then is whether there was a resulting trust for that partnership by operation of law. The question of partnership must be tried as a facte and as if there was an issue upon it. If by facts and circumstances it is established as a fact that these persons were partners in the col- liery, in which land was necessary to carry on the trade, the lease goes as an incident. The partnership being established by evidence upon which a partnership may be found, the premises necessary for the purposes of that partnership are by operation of law hold for the purposes of that partnership.\" It is pointed out by Lindley that this principle is carried to its extreme limit by Vice-Chancellor Wigram in Dale v. Hamilton (1). Even so, it is pointed out that it must be treated as a binding authority in the absence of any decision of the Court of Appeal to the contrary. It seems to us that looldng to the scheme of the Indian Act no other view can reasonably be taken. The whole concept of partnership is to embark upon a joint venture and for that purpose to bring in as capital money or even property including immovable property. Once that is done whatever is b rought in would cease to be the trading asset of the person who brought it in. It would be the trading asset of the partnership in which all the partners would have interest in proportion to their share in the joint venture of the business of partnership. The person who brought it in would, therefore, not be able to claim or exercise any exclusive right over any property which he has brought in, much less over any other partnership property. He would not be able to exercise his right even to the extent of his share in the business of the partnership. As already stated, his right during the subsistence of the partnership is to get his share of profits from time to time as may be agreed upon among the partners and after the dissolution of the partnership or with his retirement from partnership of the value of his share in the': net, partnership assets as on the date of dissolution or retirement after a deduction of liabilities and prior charges. It is true that even during the subsistence of the partnership a partner may assign his share to another. In that case what the assignee would get would be only that which is permitted by section 29(1), that is to say, the right to receive the share of profits of the assignor and accept the account of profits agreed to by the partners. There are not many decisions of the High Courts on the point. in the few that there are the preponderating view is (1) 5 Ha. 369 on appeal 2 Ph. 266. M10Sup./Cl/66-13in support of the position which we have stated. In Joharmal v. Tejrani Jagrup(1) which was decided by Jardine and Telang JJ., the latter took the view that though a partner's share does not include any specific part of any specific item of partnership property, still where the partnership is entitled to immovable property, such share does include an interest in immovable property and, there- fore, every instrument operating to create or transfer a right to such share requires to be registered under the Registration Act. In coming to this conclusion he mainly purported to rely upon an observation contained in the fifth edition of Lindley on Partnership at p. 347. This observation is not to be found in the present edition of Lindley's Partnership nor in the 9th or 10th editions which were brought to our notice. The 5th edition, however, is not available.

In these appeals by certificate from a judgment of the Punjab & Haryana High Court the main question required determination relates to the scope, ambit and true interpret of section 7 read with section 1 1 of the East Punjab Utilization of Land Act, 1949, hereinafter called the 'Act'. We need state the facts only in C.A. 825/72 (Dasau Singh & Others v. State of Haryana). The Collector Karnal out an area of 1154 Acres in villages Pehowa and Murtzapur jointly to Karnal Cooperative Society Ltd., Pehowa and Lyalpur Coop. Joint Famiing Society, Murtzapur under section 5 the Act. Owing to some dispute which arose subsequent to lease between the two societies the Registrar gave an award the matter having been referred to him for arbitration. According to that award the entire land in village Murtzapur and 17 Acres of land in village Pehowa were given to the Lyalpur Society and the remaining 357 Acres of land in village Pehowa to the Kamal Society. The lease was originally for a certain number of years but it was extended for a period of twenty which is the maximum period for which a lease could be granted under the Act. By a notice dated May 17, 1971 the signal Officer, Kaithal, issued a notice to the lessees under section of the Act. In the notice it was stated, inter alia, that the origin owners had applied for the return of the land leased out as the period of the lease had I expired. The lessees were required hand over possession to the original owners. On June 15, 197 the Sub-Divisional Officer passed an order directing the Tehsil to take possession of the land and give actual possession the ,of to the original owners. These proceedings were challenged in the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution. The High Court disposed of the writ petition together with the other writ petitions which had been filed on similar grounds by a common judgment dismissing all the petitions. In order to appreciate the points in controversy the relevant provisions of the Act may be referred to as also the background in which the Act came to be enacted. According to the State-ment of Objects and Reasons in the Bill large tracts of fertile land had remained uncultivated due to the negligence or absence of displaced local landlord. The policy of the Government was not to leave any cultivable land unsown as far as possible which was necessary to attain self- sufficiency in the matter of food. If timely action was not taken a large portion of the population would have to face starvation after 1950 when it was proposed to stop all imports of foodgrains from abroad. The Government had tried its best to persuade the landlords to cultivate the lands. There was, however, likelihood of large tracts of fertile and cultivable lands remaining unsown during Rabi 1949-50. The Bill which was introduced was, therefore, aimed at bringing about all available land in,the East Punjab under fodder and foodgrain crops. The definitions of \"land\", \"owner\" and \"tenant' as given in section 2 are as follows (a) \"Land\" means land which is not urban land and is not occupied as the site of any building in a town or village but does not include land which is leased by Government or Custodian under any law other than this Act\". (f) \"Owner\" means a person having a proprietary right in the land and includes an allottee, a usufructuary mortgagee or a lessee\". (h) \"Tenant\" means a person to whom land is leased by the Collector under the provisions of this Act\". By virtue of section 3 the Collector could issue a notice to the owner of any land which had not been cultivated for the specified period and if he did not find the explanation of the land owner to be satisfactory he could take possession of the same for the purpose of the Act. This the Collector could do notwithstanding any law to the contrary. Section 4 provided for payment of Compensation where possession of any land had been taken under section 3. Under section 5 the Collector, after taking possession under section 3, could lease out the land to any person on such terms and conditions as he deemed fit for the purpose of growing fodder and food crops. The Period of lease could not be less than 7 years or more than 20 years. Section 6 conferred power on the Collector to determine lease in certain cases. It may be mentioned that section 6 was omitted by Punjab Act 11 of 1951 but it was inserted by a later Act number 24 of 1957. According to sub-section (2) where a lease had been determined by the Collector the lessee was not to be given any compensation. Section 6 was further amended and substituted by Haryana Act 35 of 1971. Owing to certain decision of the Punjab & Haryana High Court it wasprovided in sub-section (1) that the Collector shall have the power to determine the lease after affording a reasonable opportunity to the tenant to show cause why his lease should not be determined and the possession of the land taken. Sub-sections (3) and (4) were added in these terms : Sub-s.(3) \"The principles embodied in the various provisions of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, shall not apply to any proceedings under this Act. Sub-s.(4) No civil or revenue Court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceedings in respect of the determination of lease or eviction of a tenant\". Sections 7 and II are material for our purposes. They are reproduced below -- S. 7(1) \"Where any land taken possession of by the Collector under section 3 is on the expiry of the lease to be returned to the owner, the Collector may after making such inquiry, if any, as he considers necessary, specify by order in writing the person to whom possession of the land shall be given\". (2) The delivery of possession of land to the person specified in any order made under sub-section (1) shall be a full. discharge of the Collector from all liability in respect of such delivery but shall not prejudice any rights in respect of the land which any other person may be entitled by due process of law to enforce against the person to whom possession of the land is so delivered. (3) Where the person to whom possession of any land is to be given cannot be found and has no agent or other person empowered to accept delivery on his behalf, the Collector shall cause a notice declaring that the land is released to be affixed on some conspicuous part of the land. (4) On issue of the notice referred to in sub-section (3) the, land specified in the notice shall be deemed to have been delivered to the person entitled to the possession thereof, and the Government or the Collector shall not be liable for any compensation or other claim in respect of the land for any period after the said date\". S. 1 1 \"The Collector may take or cause to be taken such steps and use or cause to be used such force as may in his opinion be reasonably necessary for securing compliance with any order made by him under this Act\". Section 14 provided for appeal and revision by any person aggrieved by an order passed by the Collector. Section 16 empowered the State Government to make rules for carrying out the provisions of the Act. The Punjab Utilization of Land Rules 1950 were framed in exercise of that power but the, Rules dealt only with matters which are not relevant. By Ordinance number 8 published in the Haryana Government Gazette Extraordinary dated September 18, 1970 a new section, section 14A was inserted. This section was as follows :- \"Bar of jurisdiction-No civil court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceedings in respect of the eviction of any person to whom land ha-,. been leased under Section 5\". The aforesaid section has been subsequently omitted by another amendment but it is admitted that during the period under consideration it was in force. The main point which was agitated before the High Court and has been agitated before us on behalf of the appellant is that even on the expiry of the term of the lease no power has been conferred on the Collector under section 7 to order restoration of possession to the owners. It is submitted that all that section 7(1) provides is to empower the Collector to make an inquiry and then specify by an order in writing the persons to whom possession of the land is to be given. In other words he can only declare who is to be treated as owner for the purpose of restoration of possession. He cannot further order that there should be a restoration of possession either to him or to the owner. For that purpose resort must be had to the provisions of the Punjab Tenancy Act 1887 or the general law under which a tenant or a lessee can be evicted after the term of his lease has come to an end. The procedure which is prescribed, according to this argument by sub-section (1) of section 7, does not relate to the process by which the eviction of the tenant can be effected There is no question of any automatic or voluntary ejectment. Now sub-section (1) of section 7 is somewhat unhappily worded. On a cursory reading of it an impression is created-that it confers a limited power on the, Collector to make an inquiry and declare who the person is to whom the possession of the land is to be restored. But this provision cannot be read in isolation and has to be interpreted in the light of the purpose and scheme of the Act as also the other relevant provisions. There can be no manner of doubt that the sole purpose for which the Act was enacted was to ensure that such lands as were capable of producing 13-L521 Sup. CI/73food or fodder but which owing to the neglect on the part of the owners were not being cultivated should be utilised for cultivated cultivation and for growing food and fodder crops. The condition precedent for applying section 3 under which the Collector could take possession was that the land should have remained uncultivate for the last six or more harvests. The Collector was to give lease which was to be for a minimum period of 7 years but which could be upto a maximum period of 20 years. This period was obviously prescribed because it was considered that the tenant should have enough period for investing money, putting in hi own effort and derive the maximum benefit by cultivating the Ian leased to him. That served two purposes; firstly it provided a incentive to him to work hard and make full use of cultivation of that land so as to reap as many crops as he could out of it The second purpose was that by his efforts the land was bound to improve if he was to get benefit out of it. Normally it would b expected that the tenant would not only spend some money of his own on the improvement of the land but he might also effect improvements of a substantial nature, particularly, when the leas was to be for a period of 20 years. He, however, knew before hand that on the expiry of the period of the lease, which in all the present cases was for 20 years, he would have to surrender possession to the owner. A printed copy of the lease has bee produced before us. It is common ground that all the leases in the present cases were on the same terms as are to be found in this printed lease. According to clause 7 of the lease the lessee was enjoined to use the land only for the purpose of sowing food and fodder crops and for no other purpose. Clause 8 shows that the lessee was tinder an obligation to reclaim and bring under cultivation 50% of the land leased by a particular date and the remaining half by another date. Under clause 10 he could erect buildings, sink wells, install tube wells etc. but it wag made quite clear that he had no right to claim compensation for the improvements effected by him nor was he entitled to remove without the previous consent in writing of the Collector any material equipment or machinery attached by him to the land. Clause 11 empowered the Collector to determine the lease and take possession of the land in case of any breach by the lessee of a of the conditions of the lease. Under clause 8 the lessee was bound on the determination of the lease by affluent of time or otherwise to peaceably vacate and give up possession of the land. Clause 15 made the lease subject to the provisions of the Act as amended from time to time. Apart from the terms of the lease, section 6 conferred power on the Collector to determine the lease, even before its expiration if the lessee committed a breach of any of the term or conditions thereof. Section 8 provided for levy of a penalty in casethe tenant failed to grow food or fodder crops on the land leased to him. It is thus clear that the Collector was empowered to take possession from the owner only after a maximum period of 20 years for which he could lease it out to a tenant. It was thus clearly contemplated that on the expiry of that period the Collector would restore possession to the owner. The Act no-where contemplated that the owner should be completely deprived of his ownership rights. The compensation to which he was entitled Linder section 4 was for the temporary deprivation of the exercise of ownership rights for the period during which the possession of the land had been taken over by the Collector and given on lease to a tenant. Section 7(1) when read in this context clearly shows that it was intended to empower the Collector to make an order in writing after the expiry of the lease saying that the possession of the land shall be given to the person named or specified in the order. The words \"to whom possession of the land shall be given\" contained the mandate under. which the Collector derived powers of directing that the possession of the land was to be given by the tenant to the owner whose name was specified in the Collector's order. The compulsory and the summary process by which that order could be enforced is to be found in section II. If the tenant did not comply with the order or direction made under section 7 the Collector could take or cause to be taken such steps or use or cause to be used such force as was section 7(1). Sub- ss. (2), (3) and (4) reinforce theabove inter predation of sub-section ( 1 ) of section 7. Once delivery of possession of the land to the person specified in the order madeunder sub-s.(1)had been effected the Collector stood discharged from all liability in respect of such delivery. Sub-ss. (3) and (4) were meant for a similar purpose when a person to whom possession of land was to be given could not be found. We are, therefore, unable to accept the contention raised on behalf of the appellants that S. 7 read with section 1 1 of the Act did not empower the Collector to make an order which would involve the eviction of the tenant in case he refused to deliver possession to the person specified therein. The contention raised that section 7 of the Act is violative of article 14 of the Constitution because there would be two or more remedies available to the authorities to which they can resort is wholly untenable. Section 14-A contained a complete bar to the civil court having any jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceedings in respect of the eviction of any person to whom land had been leased out under S. 5 of the Act Sub-section 4 of section 6 as amended also bars the jurisdiction of any civil of revenue. court to entertain any proceedings, in respect of the determination of lease or eviction of a tenant. It has been suggested '.that sub-s.(4) of section 6 is confined only to a case where a lease has bee determined by the Collector before its expiry under the provision of sub-section (1) of section 6. Sub-section (4) is in general terms and we a unable to see how it can be confined only to a lease determined under sub-section (1) of that section. It appears that it was primarily for this reason that section 14A has now been deleted as already mentioned. The next question which has been vehemently argued whether the provisions of the Tenancy Act are applicable an whether the eviction could take place only under that Act Reliance has also been placed on the provisions of the Tenance Act for sustaining the argument that no eviction could take place of the tenant unless compensation had been awarded him under the provisions of that Act. \"Land\" has been defined by the Tenancy Act by section 4(1) to mean, land which is not occupied as the site of any building in town or village and is occupied or has been let for agricultural purposes or for purposes subservient to agriculture, or for pasture and includes the sites buildings and other structures on such land. \"Tennat\" has be defined by section 4(5) to mean a person who holds land under other person and is, or but for a special contract would be, liable to pay Tent for that land to that other person. Certain categories of persons are not included but we are not concerned with the Sub-section (6) defines \"Landlord\" to mean a person under whom tenant holds land and to whom he is, or but for a special contract would be, liable to pay rent for that land. Section 40 gives grounds of ejectment of tenants for a fixed term and section 42 places certain restrictions on the ejectment of the tenant. He shall be ejected otherwise than in execution of a decree for ejectment except in cases mentioned in clauses (a) and (b) of that section Under section 48 relief against forfeiture can be given in cases mentioned therein to a tenant. Chapter VI deals with improvements by landlords and tenants. Under section 64 a tenant not having a right of occupancy can make improvements on his tenancy with the assent of his landlord. Where improvements are begun in anticipation of ejectment the tenant cannot claim any compensation by virtue of section 66. Under section 67 if a landlord tenders to a tenant a lease of his tenancy for a term of not less than 20 years from the date of the tender at the rent then paid by the tenant at such other rent as may be agreed on the tender if accepted the tenant the claim to compensation in respect of improvement previously made on the tenancy stands barred. Section 68 s that a tenant who has made improvements on his tenancy shall not be ejected until he has received compensation for their provements made by him. This is, however, subject to other sections.As has been noticed already, in the Act the word \"tenant\" has been defined to mean a person to whom the land is leased by the Collector under the provisions of the Act. The definition of \"land\" is also different from the one given in the Tenancy Act. There is no definition of landlord at all in the Act. The entire scheme of the Act establishes that it was intended to be exhaustive for the purpose for which it was enacted. It is hardly possible to regard a tenant of the Collector under the Act as falling within the definition of a \"tenant\" under the Tenancy Act. The whole purpose of the Act would be defeated if the provisions of the Tenancy Act were made applicable to it. If that had been intended there was nothing to stop the legislature from making a provision in the Act itself about the applicability of the Tenancy Act. The High Court appears to be right in coming to the conclusion that from the provisions of the Act no intention can be attributed to the legislature of creating a relationship of landlord and tenant between 'the Collector and the tenant as defined by the Act of the same nature as was provided for by the Tenancy Act. Once the above conclusion is reached the argument based on the provisions of the Tenancy Act with regard to compensation for improvements is bound to fail. As regards the general submission that a person cannot be deprived of his property without payment of compensation it must be remembered that no provision has been made for payment of any compensation ';or such improvements. The tenants, namely, the appellants had agreed to the term in the lease by which they were bound that they would not claim any compensation for the improvements made by them eluding the currency of the lease. Moreover when the tenant knew that the lease was for as long a period as 20 years, improvements must have been made with the full knowledge that on the expiry of that period possession would have to be surrendered. The tenants had also reaped all the advantage that they could by having a lease for such a long period. It is true that in the Act itself section 4 provides for payment of compensation to onwards and section 6 contains a specific clause that where a lease has been determined by the Collector the lessee shall not be entitled to any compensation. Section 7 does not contain ,in,, such provi- sion. It is significant that although where the legislature in-tended to provide for compensation it did so and where it did ,not intend to. do so it was clearly provided that the tenant shall ,not be entitled to any compensation. Section 7 is silent on the question of compensation. The legislature being fully alive to the matter of compensation it would be legitimate to assume that it did not intend to make any provision when possession was to be handed over by the tenant to the original owner pursuant to an order made under section 7. The reason apparently for not making any provision for compensation one way or the other was that it IN as clearly contemplated that the tenant would have to give up possession on the expiry of the term of the lease which was for a long period and during which he was expected, as has been observed before, to derive, the maximum benefit by means of cultivation of food and foodgrain crops.Since the provisions of the Tenancy Act have been, held to beinapplicable to the tenant as defined by the Act we are unable toehold that he was entitled to any compensation before giving possession in compliance with the order made under section 7 of the Act. Before the High Court it had beenurged on behalf of the appellants that they could be ejectedonly in accordance with the provisions of the Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act 1953. The High Court held that owing to section 21(1) nothing contained in that Act shall affect any land held by a tenant or lessee under the Government. Mr. Dutta who represented some of the appellant-, before us did not press any argument relating to the applicability of the provisions of the Land Tenures Act to the case of the appellants. At any rate, and this position has been rightly conceded by the counsel for the respondents, the appellants cannot be debarred from taking benefit of or seeking protection under any enactment if they can establish that they are governed by its provisions. Dr. Singhvi who argued Civil Appeal number 825/72 has raised some other points in addition to those already disposed of According to him after the Registrar of Cooperative Societies had settled the dispute between the Kamal Society and the Lyallpur Society the latter took no interest in 175 acres of land situate in village Pehowa which had been allotted to it and which were brought under cultivation by the appellants Dasuadha Singh and others. This. it is said, was done with the tacit approval of the Collector. It is, however, admitted that the lease was in favour of the aforesaid societies and the allegation that the appellants brought this land under cultivation with the tacit approval of the Collector contained in para 5 of the writ petition was denied in the written statement filed on behalf of the respondents. In the Jamabandi entries of 1963-64 the entry was as follows \"The Collector, Karnal, Lessor, Karnal Cooperative Farmers, Karnal, Lyallpur Cooperative Farmers, Karnal in equal shares, lessees. Cultivation Lyallpur Cooperative Farmers, Karnal, through Dasaudha Singh ................ tenants-at-will\". It is difficult to understand how the Jamabandi entry helps the appellants at all. It seems to indicate that the persons who were shown as tenants at-will were cultivating it under the societies which were the lessees. They could not, therefore, claim any better rights than the societies which were the tenants of the Collector and amenable to his jurisdiction under the Act. It may be mentioned that in the High Court this point does not appear to have been argued and we do not have the benefit of any finding of that court on that point. It has, further, been submitted on behalf of the appellants that before any orders were made under section 7 of the Act the tenants or the persons in occupation of the lands in question should have been given an opportunity of being heard to satisfy the well settled rule of natural justice. Under section 7 the Collector has to decide and name the owners to whom possession shall be given. The tenant can have no locus standi in that matter in which if there are any rival claimants they alone would be interested. The scheme of section 7 is such that it is not possible to read into it any requirement of a notice being issued to the tenants before any order is made by the Collector under that section. Before the High Court only in one case i.e. C.W. 2171/71 it was pointed out that the petitioners therein had purchased 6 acres, of from the original land owner and as such the Collector could not legally dispossess them from that portion of the land. The Additional Advocate General conceded that in case that area had been purchased by the petitioners in that writ petition they would not be dispossessed and the possession would be restored to them if dispossession had taken place. On behalf of a number of appellants it has been contended that several portions of lands in dispute have been purchased from the original owners and the purchasers are actually in possession. It is not disputed by the counsel for the respondents that if any person has acquired the ownership rights in any of the lands which were the subject matter of the writ petition he can approach the Collector who will consider his case fully and if it is proved that he has become an owner then his possession will not be disturbed and no orders will be made with regard to the area in his occupation or possession under section 7. This will fully safeguard the interest of those persons who have acquired ownership rights either before or during the pendency of the proceedings in the High Court% or even in this Court. Lastly we cannot help observing that the appellants will be put to a good deal of hardship by being asked to give up all lands which they had been cultivating for so many years and which probably are the main source of their livelihood. But that hardship could be alleviated or some relief given by legislation alone. The court is unable to do anything in the matter. In the result the appeals fail and they are dismissed but there will be no order as to costs. S.C.

(From the Judgment and Order dated 20.3.1971 of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Miscellaneous Petition number 313/70). I. N. Shroff, for the appellants. S.V. Gupte, J. D. Jain, Miss Kanwaljit Miglani and Balram Sahgal for the respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KHANNA, J.--Whether sales tax is payable by a photographer under the Madhya Pradesh General Sales Tax Act (Act 2 of 1959) when the photographer takes photographs or does other photographic work and thereafter supplies the photographic prints to his client or customer is the question which arises for determi- nation in this appeal on certificate against the judgment of Madhya Pradesh High Court reported in 28 STC 1. The High Court answered the question in the negative in favour of the assessee respondent. The respondent is the proprietor of Kame Photo Studio. He has apart from his main shop two branches. He carries on business, inter alia, of buying and selling photographic goods. After buying photographic goods he either sells them to his customers or uses them in three ways--(1) in taking photographs and supplying prints thereof, (2) in making enlargements for the clients who bring their own negatives, and (3) in preparing positive prints of the same size from the negatives brought by the clients. For doing these various types of works the assessee respondent charges consolidated amount depending upon the work involved and the size and number of prints demanded by the client. The sales tax authorities assessed the respondent for different periods from April 1, 1964 to March 31, 1969 to sales tax on his turnover on best judgment basis as he had not kept full and complete accounts. It may be convenient to refer to the figures of assessment for one of the years. For the year 1964-65 the total turnover of the respondent was taken to be Rupees 41,500. Out of this amount a deduction of Rupees 6,500 was allowed as relatable to developing and enlargement which was considered to be not chargeable to tax. The balance of Rupees 35,000 was divided into two parts Rupees 12,000 being treated as relatable to sale of materials as such and the rest Rupees 23,000 being taken to be the re- ceipts on account of the supply of photo prints to those who got themselves photographed at the studios. The respondent filed writ petition to challenge the levy of sales tax on the last item, namely, the item for the supply of photo prints. The contention of the respondent was that in taking a photograph, preparing its negative and thereafter the final positive print for supplying the same to the client, the respondent undertakes a contract of work and labour and does not enter into a sale transaction. It was also stated on behalf of the respondent that the prepared positive print was not a marketable commodity and he could not sell the photograph of one person to any other person except with the former's consent. As against that, the case of the appellants was that the respondent was carrying on a commercial activity in the nature of trade and business and the finished photographs supplied by him to his customer was a commodity and the supply of same attracted the levy of sales tax. The High Court, on consideration of the matter, came to the conclusion that the respondent only undertook the contract of work and labour and did not enter into a sale transaction. The respondent as such was held not liable to pay sales tax in respect of the item to which the writ petition related. The High Court while accepting the writ petition also observed as under: \"We may lastly make it clear that in this case we are not called upon to go into the question whether the material used in preparing the photograph is sold and taxa- ble. The petitioner has alleged in the petition that he was paid full tax on the value of such material and the respondents have neither denied the fact nor have claimed tax on such material. We, therefore, express no opinion on that question and need not consider either Masanda's case (1957) 8 STC 370, where the only question referred to this Court was whether such material alone could be taxed, or the observations of the Bombay High Court in Camera House Case (1970)25 STC 354, about severability of the contract into one spearately for service and supply of material.\" In appeal before us Mr. Shroff has assailed the judgment of the High Court. As against that,. Mr. Gupte on behalf of the respondent has canvassed for the correctness of the view taken by the High Court. The question as to whether a contract is a contract of work and labour or a contract for sale is not one free from difficulty. The reason for that is that in border line cases the distinction between the two types of contract is very fine. This is particularly so when the contract is a composite one involving both a contract of work and labour and a contract of sale. Nevertheless, the distinction between the two rests on a clear principle. A contract of sale is one whose main object is the-transfer of property in, and the delivery of the possession of, a chattel as a chattel to the buyer. Where the principal object of work undertaken by the payee of the price is not the transfer of a chattel qua chattel, the contract is one of work and labour. The test is whether or not the work and labour bestowed end in anything that can properly become the sub- ject of sale; neither the ownership of materials, nor the value of the skill and labour as compared with the value of the materials, is conclusive, although such matters may be taken into consideration in determining, in the circum- stances of a particular case, whether the contract is in substance one for work and labour or one for the sale of a chattel (see The State of Himachal Pradesh & ORS v. Associ- ated Hotels of India(1). The respondent company in that case carried on business as hoteliers. As a part of its business as hoteliers, the company received guests in its several hotels to whom, besides furnishing lodging, it also served several other amenities, such as public and private rooms, bath with hot and cold running water, linen, meals during stated hours. The bill tendered to the guests was all-inclusive one, namely, a fixed amount for the stay in the hotel for each day and did not contain different items in respect of each of the amenities. The question which arose for determination was whether the company was liable to pay sales tax under the Punjab General Sales Tax Act, 1948 in respect of meals served in the hotel to the ,guests coming there for stay It was held by the Constitution Bench of this Court that the transaction was essentially one and indivisible, namely, one of receiving a customer in the hotel to stay. It was essentially one of service by the hotelier in the performance of which, and as part of the amenities incidental to the service, the hotelier served meals at stated hours. The revenue, it was held, was (1) 29 S.T.C. 474.not entitled to split up the transaction into two parts, one of service and the other of sale of food-stuffs. This Court accordingly came to the conclusion that there was no sale of food-stuffs and the respondent company was not liable to pay sales tax in respect of the meals served to the guests in the hotel. In arriving at this conclusion this Court observed as under: \"Thus, in considering whether a transaction falls within the purview of sales tax, it becomes necessary at the threshold to deter- mine the nature of the contract involved in such a transaction for the purpose of ascer- taining whether it constitutes a contract of sale or a contract of work or service. If it is of the latter kind it obviously would not attract the tax. From the decisions earlier cited it clearly emerges that such determina- tion depends in each case upon its facts and circumstances. Mere passing of property in an article or commodity during the course of the performance of the transaction in question does not render it a transaction of sale. For, even in a contract purely of work or service, it is possible that articles may have to be used by the person executing the work and property in such articles or materi- als may pass to the other party. That would not necessarily convert the contract into one of sale of those materials. In every case the court would have to find out what was the primary object of the transaction and the intention of the parties while entering into it. It may in some cases be that even while enter- ing into a contract of work or even service, parties might enter into separate agreements, one of work and service and the other of sale and purchase of materials to be used in the course of executing the work or performing the service. But, then in such cases the trans- action would not be one and indivisible, but would fail into two separate agreements, one of work or service and the other of sale.\" Reliance in the above cited case was placed upon an earlier decision of this Court in the case of State of Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley & Co. (Madras) Ltd.(1) wherein the Constitution Bench of this Court held that in a building contract the property in materials used, does not pass to the other party to the contract as movable property. It would so pass if that be the agreement between the parties. But if there was no such agreement and the contract was only to construct a building, then the materials used therein would, in the opinion of the Court, become the property of the other party to the contract only on the theory of accre- tion. The distinction between a contract of sale and contract for skill and labour has been discussed at page 10 of the 4th Edn. of \"Sale of Goods\" by P.S. Atiyah. The following passage in that book has a material beating so far as the present case is concerned: (1) 9 S.T.C. 353. \"The distinction between contracts of sale and contracts for skill and labour has agitated the courts for many years, and though its importance has been greatly diminished by the repeal of Sect. 4 of the Act, it still cannot be ignored. It was thought for many years that Lee v. Griffin (1861), 1 B.&S. 272 laid down that, if a contract would result in the trans- fer of the property in goods from one party to another, then it must be a contract of sale. The view was exploded in Robinson v. Graves (1935) 1 K.B. 579 where it was held that a contract to paint a portrait was a contract for skill and labour and not a contract for the sale o[ goods, despite the fact that it was the object of the contract to transfer the property in the completed portrait to the defendent. Green L.J. stated the law as fol- lows (1935) 1 K.B. at p. 587: If the substance of the contract .... is that skill and labour have to be exercised for the production of the articles and .... it is only ancillary to that that there will pass from the artist to his client or customer some materials in addition to the skill in- volved in the production of the portrait, that does not make any difference to the result, because the substance of the contract is the skill and experience of the artist in produc- ing the picture.\" Keeping the above principles in view, we may now turn to the facts of the present case. When a photographer like the respondent undertakes to take photograph, develop the negative, or do other photographic work and thereafter supply the prints to his client, he cannot be said to enter into a contract for sale of goods. The contract on the contrary is for use of skill and labour by the photographer to bring about a desired result. The occupation of a photographer, except in so far as he sells the goods pur- chased by him, in our opinion, is essentially one of skill and labour. A good photograph reveals not only the aes- thetic sense and artistic faculty of the photographer, it also reflects his skill and labour. A good photograph in most cases is indeed a thing of beauty. It not only seeks to mirror and portray a scene from actual life, it also catches and preserves for the future what belongs to and is a part of the fleeting moment. The ravage brought about by the passage of time, the decay and the ageing process which inevitably set in as the years roll by leave what is pre- served in the photograph unaffected. It is no wonder that an old photograph revives nostalgic memories of days no more, but to which we rook back through the mist of time with fondness even though such fondness has a tinge of sadness. We, therefore, find no cogent ground to disagree with the High Court in so far as it has decided against the revenue and has held the contract to be one for work and labour. Our attention has been invited during the course of arguments to some decisions of the High Courts. It is, in our opinion, not necessary to deal with those cases 12 -- 1546 SCI/76because after giving the matter our consideration was are of the opinion, that the view taken by the High Court in the judgment under appeal substantially represents the correct position in law. The appeal consequently fails and is dismissed, but in the circumstances without costs. M.P.

These appeals by special leave are against the judgment and order dated 24th April, 1987 passed by the High Court of Bombay dismissing criminal appeal number 636 of 1986 filed by masters of two trawlers against their conviction and sentence and allowing appeal number 496 of 1986 filed by Commander S.D. Baijal against the acquittal of accused numbers 3 and 4, i.e. the charterer company and its managing Director and also releasing the trawlers. The High Court convicted the accused numbers 3 and 4 for contravention of sub- section 6 of section 5 of the Maritime Zones of India Act, 1981 read with section 7 thereof and rule 16 of Maritime Zones of India Rules, 1982. The High Court also ordered confiscation of the two trawlers and to vest the same in favour of Central Government under section 13 of the Maritime Zones of C, India Act The trawlers in questions which are foreign vessel are chartered by respondent numbers 4 and 5 of this appeal for the purpose of fishing in Maritime Zone of India after obtaining permit under section 5 of Maritime Zones of India Act, in short M.Z.I. Act. These two trawlers 11 along with three other pairs of trawlers were apprehended and seizedby Coast Guard Ship Vikram commanded by Commander S.D. Baijal for fishing operations in the-exclusive economic zone of India in violation of the terms and conditions of permit and the letter of intent granted to that company by the Government of India under section 5(4) of M.Z.I. Act and in violation of Maritime Zones of India Rules, in short M.Z.I. Rules, 1982 as amended. They were prosecuted by Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, 8th Court Ballard Estate, Bombay on the complaint of Commander S.D. Baijal filed as authorised officer under section 19 of the M.Z.I. Act. The masters of the two trawlers, the respondent numbers 2 and 3 of this appeal were convicted and sentenced to pay a fine of Rupees 60,000 and Rupees 40,000 respectively and the other accused respondents numbers 4 and 5 were acquitted and the trawlers and the fishes thereon were ordered to be released on payment of the detention charges. Of the other three pairs of foreign trawlers chartered by Indian company for fishing in the Maritime Zone of India under permit granted under M.Z.I. Act which were seized and prosecuted, two pairs of trawlers with fishes thereon were ordered to be confiscated while one pair of these trawlers were directed to be released. The masters of each pair of trawler were similarly convicted and sentenced to pay fine for violation of provisions of the said Act and the Rules framed thereunder. The masters of the pair of trawlers filed criminal appeal number 536 of 1986 against their conviction and sentence while the complaining Commander S.D. Baijal filed criminal appeal number 496 of 1986 against the order of acquittal of respondent numbers 4 and S i.e. the Managing Director of the Company and the Company and also against the release of the pair of trawlers in spite of conviction of the masters under section 12(b) of M.Z.I. Act by the Magistrate. These two appeals were heard together and disposed of by a common judgment by the High Court, Bombay whereby criminal appeal number 636 of 1986 was allowed in part by modifying the sentence of the masters of the trawlers from R.I. for one year to S.I. for 9 months and from R.I. for 9 months to S.I. for 6 months. In criminal appeal number 496 of 1986 the accused respondent numbers 3 and 4 i.e. the Managing Director and the Company were convicted and sentenced to pay a fine of Rupees 30,000 each and the trawlers were ordered to be confiscated with the fishes thereon or in case of sale of the same the proceeds thereof. The High Court also held the masters of trawlers guilty under Rule 8(1)(q) and they were convicted under section 12(a) instead of section 12(b) of the M.Z.I. Act but maintained the sentence of penalty. It is against this judgment and order the instant appeals on special leave have been filed. Criminal . A. numbers 646-47 of 87 and Criminal . A. numbers 650-51 of 1987 arise out of a common judgment made by the High Court of Bombay on April 24, 1987 modifying in part the judgment and order made by the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, 38th Court, Ballard Estate, Bombay in Criminal Case number 28 of 1984 passed in Criminal Appeal numbers 497 and 637 of 1986. The Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate convicted the masters of the trawlers i.e. accused numbers 1 and 2 for contravening Rule 8(1)(G) read with Rule 16 and Section 20(b) of M.Z.I. Act and sentenced them to pay a fine of Rupees 60,000 and Rupees 40,000 respectively; in default of payment of fine to suffer R.I. for 1 year and 9 months respectively. The Magistrate also made an order confiscating the trawlers JIANN TAI number 301 and JIANN TAI number 302 along with the fishing gear, equipments, stores, cargo and fish and directed that the same shall vest with the Central Government together with the proceeds of the sale of fish, if any, under order of the Court.

The order of confiscation of the two trawlers was also maintained. Criminal . A. number 637/86 filed by the masters of the trawlers was dismissed with the modification that the conviction made u/s 12(b) was altered to 12(a) of M.Z.I. Act and the sentence of R.I. for 1 year and 9 months respectively in default payment of fine were modified as S.I. for h months and S months respectively. Criminal . A. numbers 648-49 87 and Criminal . A. numbers 652-53 of 1987 arise out of a common judgment passed in Criminal Appeal numbers 495 and 634 of 1986 by the High Court of Bombay on 24th April, 1987 dismissing the appeals of the masters of the vessels and allowing the appeals filed on behalf of the prosecution. All these aforesaid appeals were filed against the judgment and order passed by the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate in Criminal Case number 27 of 1984 wherein the Magistrate convicted and sentenced the masters of the trawlers with the imposition of fine of Rupees 30,000 and Rupees 40,000 on accused numbers 1 and 2 respectively for contravening Rule 8(1)(g) and Rule 16 of the M Z I. Rules and also of the offence u/s 5 of the Act and imposing penalty u/s 12(b) of the M.Z.I. Act. The Magistrate, however, acquitted the accused numbers 3 and 4 i.e. the Charterer Company and its Managing Director and directed the release of the trawlers in favour of the masters of these trawlers. The Criminal . A. number 634 of 1986 filed by themasters of the vessels was dismissed by the High Court of Bombay and the convinction and sentence u/s 12(b) of M.Z.I. Act was altered to one u/s 12(a) of the said Act. Criminal . A. number 495 of 1986 filed on behalf of the prosecution was allowed and the accused numbers 3 and 4 i.e. the Charterer Company as well as the Managing Director of the Company were convicted and sentenced to pay a fine of Rupees 30,000. The vessel as well as the fishing equipment were confiscated and the same were directed to vest in favour of the Central Government. Criminal . A. numbers 654-55 of 87 and Criminal . A. number 666 of 1987 arise out of a common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Bombay in Criminal . Appeal numbers 660 and 635 of 1986. These criminal appeals were filed against the judgment and order passed in criminal case number 26 of 1984 made on 21st May, 1986 by the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, 38th Court, Ballard Estate. The Magistrate convicted and sentenced the accused numbers 1 and 2 i.e. the masters of the vessel to pay a fine of Rupees 60,000 and Rupees 40,000 respectively; in default to undergo R.I. for 1 year and 9 months respectively. The Magistrate also made an order confiscating the trawlers BWA Sheng number 21 and HQA Sheng number 22 together with fishing gear, equipment, stores, cargo and fish therein. Criminal . A. number 660/86 was filed by the Charterers. Criminal . A. number 635 of 1986 was filed by the masters of the trawlers. Criminal . A. number 635 of 1986 was dismissed with the modification that conviction and sentence passed u/s 12(b) of the M.Z.I. Act was altered to one u/s 12(a) of the said Act and Criminal . A. number 660 of 1986 was dismissed with the modification that the imprisonment awarded in default of payment of fine imposed on the appellant was altered to S.l. for 4 months instead of R.I for 6 months The order of confiscation of trawlers passed by the Magistrate was also confirmed. The facts and issues involved in all these appeals being similar we dispose of these appeals by a common judgment. It has been first contended on behalf of the appellant that at the time of apprehension of the trawlers no fish was found on board and the net was not wet. There was no evidence that fish on board was seized nor there was any evidence to show what had happened to fish or who put the fish in the hold of the trawlers. It has, therefore, been submitted that no presumption under section 22 of the said Act can be drawn that the trawlers were engaged in fishing within the exclusive economic zone of India in contravention of the provisions of the Act and the Rules framed thereunder. This contention cannot be considered in this appeal under special leave as there has been concurrent findingsby the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate as well as by the High Court that there was fish on board which includes the hold of the trawlers. The learned single Judge observed: \"I am, however; unable to accept that for a minor omission to make entry of finding of the fish or the net in the officers' diary can by itself negative the evidence of actual finding of the fish and the wet net on the deck and in my view the Authority quoted will have no application to the facts of this case.\" The High Court further held on a consideration of the evidence that the fishing trawlers were fishing in a depth within 40 fathoms and the finding of the Magistrate on this score is unassailable. There has been violation of amended Rule 8(1)(q) of M.Z,.I. Rules. Condition 2(S) of the permit provides that any condition could be imposed which would be binding on the charterers, masters of the trawlers. Rule 8(1)(q) requires the. trawlers to fish at a depth of more than 40 fathoms. This condition in the permit has been violated. The masters and the charterers have been accordingly convicted under section 12(a) by the High Court as the violation is with regard to the area of operation specified in the permit and the penalty provided for the same is not exceeding Rupees 5 lakhs. As the Magistrate has exercised his discretion in sentencing the masters to pay lesser amount as penalty the High Court did not consider it proper to interfere with the same. The main argument on behalf of the appellant was focussed on the vital question as to whether the words used in Section 13 of M.Z.I. Act \"shall also be liable to confiscation\" mandate that the foreign vessel used in connection with the commission of the offence as soon as the masters have been convicted under section 10 or 11 or 12 of the said Act, shall be confiscated or it is the discretion of the Court to order either for release of the vessel or for confiscation of the vessel together with the fish and other equipment, cargo and fishing gear considering the graveness of the offence. It has been strenuously urged before us that the object of the M.Z.I. Act is to prevent poaching of fishes in the exclusive economic zone of India by foreign vessels without any licence or permit as required under the said Act. Section 10 provides that where a vessel contravenes the provisions of Section 3. the owner or master of the vessel shall be punishable for imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or with a fine not exceeding Rupees 15 lakhs; where the contravention takes place in an area within the exclusive economic zone of India, the punishment of fine will not exceedrupees ten lakhs. Similarly for contravention of licence the punishment of fine will not exceed rupees ten lakhs whereas in case of contravention of the provisions of the permit in respect of the area of operation or method of fishing, the punishment of fine will not exceed rupees five lakhs and in any other case the punishment of fine will not exceed rupees fifty thousand. Referring to these provisions providing for different kinds of penalty, it has been urged that the confiscation of the vessel for contravention of the permit is not warranted in as much as the punishment provided for such contravention u/s 12 is much less than the punishment provided for in respect of contravention of licence as well as contravention of Section 3 of the said Act It has, therefore, been submitted that the provisions of Section 13 of the said Act are not mandatory but directory. This leaves option to the Court to use its discretion to pass an order of confiscation of vessel in the facts and circumstances of the case. The trawlers in question were chartered by the company and the company duly obtained permit under Section 5 of M.Z.I. Act, 1981 for fishing in economic zones of India at a depth of not less than 40 fathoms. It has been submitted that it is not possible to fish at the said depth as depth varies from place to place and for such a minor infringement the penalty of confiscation of the vessel i.e. the fishing trawlers should not be awarded as the trawlers are fishing in the maritime zone of India under permit granted by the Government of India in favour of the Indian company which chartered those trawlers. Moreover, different penalties are prescribed for different offences committed under sections 10, 11 and 12 of M.Z.I. Act according to the graveness of the offence. The penalty of confiscation of the vessel under Section 13 if found to be imperative, the provisions will be arbitrary. The words \"shall also be liable to confiscation\" in Section 13 of the said Act have to be interpreted as not mandatory in the context they have been used but discretionary. It is left to the discretion of the Court to award this sentence of confiscation in case of commission of grave offences In support of this submission the decisions in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Azad Bharat Finance Co. & ANR , [1966] (Supp,) SCR 473; Indo-China Steam Navigation Co. Ltd. v. Jasjit Singh, Additional Collector of Customs & ORS , [1964] 6 SCR 594 and Superintendent and Legal Remembrancer of Legal Affairs to the Govt. Of West Bengal v. Abani Maity, [1979] 3 SCR 472 have been cited at the bar wherein similar words \"shall also be liable to confiscation\" have been used. It is convenient to ascertain the legal position before deciding the question raised. In the Statement of objects and Reasons of The Maritime Zones of India (Regulation of Fishing by Foreign Vessels) Act, 1981 it is stated: \"There has been an increase in poaching activities of foreign fishing vessels in our exclusive economic zone. There have also been instances of foreign fishing vessels chartered by Indian parties indulging in such activities. To prevent such activities and to protect our fishermen from the hardship caused by poaching vessels, it is necessary to regulate fishing activities by foreign fishing vessels and to provide for deterrent punishment by way of heavy fines and confiscation of foreign fishing vessels engaged in such activities. Section 2(a) defines \"exclusive economic zone of India\" as meaning the exclusive zone of India in accordance with the provisions of section 7 of the Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive Economic Zone and other Maritime Zones Act, 1976. According to Section 2(i) \"owner\" of vessel a includes any association of persons whether incorporated or not, by whom the vessel is owned or chartered; Section 2(j) defines \"permit\" meaning a permit granted or deemed to have been granted under section 5. Section 3 states that subject to the provisions of the act, no foreign vessel shall, except under and in accordance with: (a) a licence granted under section 4; or (b) a permit granted under section 5, by the Central Government, be used for fishing within any maritime zone of India. Section 4 provides for procedure for making application for licence by the owner of a foreign vessel for fishing within any maritime zone of India and grant of licence by Central Government. Section 5 prohibits fishing by Indian citizens using foreign vessels within any maritime zone of India without obtaining permit and the procedure for grant of permit to charterer has been specified therein. Sub-section (6) of Section 5 of the Act provides: \"A person holding a permit under this section shall ensure that every person employed by him complies, in the course of such employment, with the provisions of this Act or any rule or order made thereunder and the conditions of such permit. Section 10 says that for contravention of provisions of Section 3, the owner of master of the vessel: B (a) in case of contravention of territorial waters of India shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or with fine not exceeding rupees fifteen lakh or with both; and (b) in a case where contravention takes place in any area within the exclusive economic zone of India, shall be punishable with fine not exceeding rupees ten lakh. Section 11 prescribes punishment of fine not exceeding rupees ten lakhs in case of contravention of licence. Section 12(a) prescribes punishment of fine not exceeding rupees five lakhs where the contravention relates to the area of operation or method of fishing specified in the permit and; section 12(b) in any other case with fine not exceeding rupees fifty thousand. Section 13 which is relevant for deciding these appeals is as under: \"Confiscation of vessels, etc.-(1) Where any person is convicted of an offence under section 10 or section 11 or section 12, the foreign vessel used in or in connection with the commission of the said offence, together with its fishing gear, equipment, stores and cargo and any fish on board such ship or the proceeds of the sale of any fish ordered to be sold under the second proviso to clause (a) or subsection (4) of section 9 shall also be liable to confiscation. (2) the foreign vessel or other things confiscated under subsection (1) shall vest in the Central Government. \" Other provisions of the said Act are not necessary for our purpose and as such they are not stated herein.Thus, it is crystal clear that the M.Z.I. Act has been enacted withthe object of preventing illegal poaching of fishes by foreign vessels including foreign vessels chartered by Indian parties by providing deterrent punishment to protect Indian fishermen. The objects and reasons of the Act are to be taken into consideration in interpreting the provisions of the Statute and not the debates in Parliament on the Bill. This has been observed by this Court in K.P. Varghese v. The Income-tax officer, Ernakulam and another, [1982] 1 SCR 629 as under. \"Now it is true that the speeches made by the Members of the Legislature on the floor of the House when a Bill for enacting a statutory provision is being debated are inadmissible for the purpose of interpreting the statutory provision but the speech made by the Mover of the Bill explaining the reason for the introduction of the Bill can certainly be referred to for the purpose of ascertaining the mischief sought to be remedied by the legislation and the object and purpose for which the legislation is enacted. This is in accord with the recent trend in juristic thought not only in western countries but also in India that interpretation of a statute being an exercise in the ascertainment of meaning, everything which is logically relevant should be admissible . . . . It is pertinent to mention that in interpreting a statute the Court has to ascertain the will and policy of the legislature as discernible from the object and scheme of the enactment and the language used therein. Viewed in this context it is apparent that the said Act has been made with the sole purpose of preventing poaching of fishes by foreign vessels chartered by Indian citizens within the exclusive economic zone of India as specified in Rule 8(1)(q) of Maritime Zone of India Rules as amended in 1982 as well as in breach of the provisions of the said Act and the terms and conditions of permit issued under Section 5 of the said act. Section 8 under the heading \"Prohibition of fishing in Maritime zone of India by foreign vessels\" expressly prohibits foreign vessels from fishing in maritime zone of India except under and in accordance with a licence or permit granted by Central Government and breach of the same has been made punishable under Section 10 of the said Act. Similarly violation of the terms and conditions of licence and permit granted under Sections 4 or 5 is punishable under Sections 11 or 12 respectively of the said Act. Section 13 of the said Act expressly says that besides conviction and sentence of the masters of the vessels and charterers, the vessel is little to be confiscated with fishes therein. The contention on behalf of the appellants is that the words \"shall also be liable to confiscation\" as used in Section 13 of the said Act do not mean that it is mandatory to confiscate the vessel, i.e. the trawlers as the masters of the vessel have been convicted and sentenced to pay penalty under section 12 of the Act. As various punishments have been provided for different types of offences, it is left to the discretion of the court to order confiscation of the vessel or to release the vessel In the case of Indo-China Steam Navigation Co. Ltd. v. Jasjit Singh, Additional Collector of Customs & ors., [1964] 6 SCR 594 the foreign vessel 'Eastern Saga' arrived at Calcutta from the Far East carrying a legitimate cargo. On its arrival at the port the Custsoms officers on search found a hole in sailors' accommodation which was covered with a piece of wood and over-painted. From the hole the Customs officers found out a large quantity of gold in bars valued at about Rupees 23 lakhs. The Additional Collector of Custom found that the vessel had clearly rendered itself liable to confiscation under section 167(12A) of Sea Customs Act, 1878 because it had infringed the provisions of Section 52A of the said Act. He also confiscated the gold bars under Section 167(8) read with Section 23A of the Foreign Exchange Regulations Act. He also directed that 'Eastern Saga' be confiscated u/s 167(12A) of the said Act and in lieu of confiscation he gave the owners of the ship an opportunity to pay a fine of Rupees 25 lakhs within a period of 30 days of the despatch of the order. This order was challenged in an appeal under special leave before this Court. Section 167(12A) provides that if a vessel contravenes section 52A it \"shall be liable to confiscation\". It was held: \"... The context seems to require that it is not open to the Customs to refuse to confiscate the vessel on the ground that there are any extenuating circumstances surrounding the contravention of Section 52A in a given case and that it would be unfair to impose the penalty of confiscation. Two penalties are prescribed, one is the confiscation of the ship, and the other is a fine against the master. In regard to the latter penalty it is within the discretion of the Customs Authority to decide what amount of penalty should be imposed; just as in the case of the first penalty it is not open to it to say that it would not impose the penalty of confiscation against the offending ship, so in the case of the second penalty it is not open to it to say that it will not levy any penalty against the master .. It must be regarded as an elementary requirement of clause 12A that as soon as the offence referred to in column I of the said clause is proved, some penalty has to be imposed and clause 12A indicates that two penalties have to be imposed and not one there being discretion in regard to the penalty imposable against the master as regards the amount of the said penalty. Therefore, we do not think it would be possible to take the view that if there are extenuating circumstances attending the contravention of Section 52A in a given case the Customs Authority can refrain from confiscating the vessel. Confiscation of the vessel is the immediate statutory consequence of the finding that an offence under clause 12A is established, just as the imposition of some penalty against the master is another statutory consequence of the same contravention.\" Section 183 lays down that whenever an order of confiscation is made the Adjudicating Authority has to give the owner of the goods which includes the vessel, an opportunity to pay fine in lieu of confiscation. Section 183 confers discretion on the Authority to determine what amount of fine should be imposed. Section 11 of the M.P. Opium Act as amended where the words \"shall be liable to confiscation\" occurred came up for consideration before this Court in the case of State of Madhya Pradesh v. Azad Bharat Finance Co. Ltd . & ANR , [1966] (Supp) SCR 473 a truck hired by one Harbhajan Singh from the respondent company was found on search to have contained contraband opium. Harbhajan Singh was tried for offences u/s 9A and 9B of the opium Act (10 of 1979). The Magistrate while acquitting him on the ground that he had no knowledge, ordered for confiscation of the truck as the word \"shall\" occurring in Section 11 of the Act make it mandatory to confiscate. Sessions Judge on revision affirmed the order of the Magistrate. High Court on revision held that the words \"shall be liable to confiscation\" in section 11 did not mean that it was mandatory to confiscate. It is the discretion of the Court whether to make an order for confiscation of the conveyance or not according to the facts and circumstances of the case. This Court had observed that provisions of Section 11 of the Madhya Bharat Act are permissive and not obligatory. Three factorswere taken into consideration in construing Section 11. \"First, it would be unjust to confiscate the truck of a person if he has no knowledge whatsoever that the truck was being used for transporting the opium. Secondly, it is a penal statute and it should if possible be construed in such a way that a person who has not committed or abetted any offence should not be visited with a penalty. Thirdly, if confiscation was obligatory under the section, the section may have to be struck down as imposing an unreasonable restriction under Article 19 of the Constitution . Section 11 of the Madhya Bharat Act is not therefore to be construed as obligatory and it is for the court to consider in each case whether the articles in which the contraband opium is found or it being transported should be confiscated or not having regard to all the circumstances of the case.\" The earlier decision of this Court has not been referred to in this case. Moreover what appears to have weighed with this court was that unless the owner of the truck knew that hirer used the truck in transporting contraband opium it would be unjust to confiscate the conveyance. In the instant case the owner of the vessel has been defined in Section 2(i) of M.Z.I. Act as including any association of persons, whether incorporated or not, by whom the vessel is owned or chartered. The charterer company and its Managing Director, have been convicted for contravention of Section S of the Act and Rule 8(1)(q) of the Rules framed thereunder and penalty has been awarded. So the charterer who is deemed to be the owner of the trawler was held guilty of the offence of breach of terms of the permit. In the case of Superintendent and Legal Remembrancer of Legal Affairs to the Govt. Of West Bengal v. Abani Haity, [1979] 3 SCR 472 the car belonging to Abani Haity was searched and contraband ganja was found concealed in the car owned by Abani Haity. The Magistrate passed order of conviction and sentence against him but he did not make any order for confiscation of the car used for transporting the contraband article. This matter ultimately came up before this Court in an appeal by special leave. This Court held on an interpretation of Section 63(1) of the Bengal Excise Act, 1909 that the words \"shall be liable to confiscaticn\" as used in the context convey an absolute imperative to confiscate the vehicle used for transport of the contraband goods. It was further held that it is incumbent on the Magistrate to pass, at the conclusion of the trial, in addition to the conviction and sentence. an order of confiscation of the car by which such offencehas been committed. The word \"liable\" occurring in many statutes, has been held as not conveying the sense of an absolute obligation or penalty but merely importing a possibility of attracting such obligation, or penalty even where this word is used along with the words \"shall be\". Thus, where an American Revenue Statute declared that for the commission of a certain act, a vessel \"shall be liable to forfeiture\", it has held that \"these words do not effect a present absolute forfeiture but only give a right to have the vessel forfeited under due process of law. Similarly, it has been held that in Section 302, Indian Penal Code, the phrase, \"shall also be liable to fine\" does not convey a mandate but leave it to the discretion of the Court convicting an accused of the offence of murder to impose or not to impose fine in addition to the sentence of death or transportation for life.\" In the case of F.N. Roy v. Collector of Customs, Calcutta, [1957] S.C.R 1151 the petitioner on the basis of a notification dated March 16, 1953 issued by the Government of India giving general permission to all persons to import into India from certain countries any goods of any of the description specified in the schedule annexed to the notification had placed an order with a company in Japan for supply of certain goods called in the trade Zip Chains. The goods on arrival in Calcutta Port could not be cleared from the Port as a notice was issued by the Collector of Customs for Appraisement stating that the petitioner did not possess valid import licence for the goods and asked him to show cause why the same should not be confiscated and action taken against the petitioner u/s 167(8) of the Sea Customs Act. The petitioner submitted a written answer stating that the Zip Chains imported by him were chains of the kind free import of which has been permitted and as such no licence to import them was necessary. The petitioner was again asked by the Customs authorities whether he wanted a personal hearing. The petitioner did not reply to the same. The Collector of Customs made an order confiscated the goods and imposing a penalty of Rupees 1,000 on the petitioner. The petitioner thereafter filed an appeal which was dismissed on the ground that it was barred by limitation. The petitioner thereafter made an application for quashing the order of confiscation of goods and imposing penalty on him. This application was dismissed. The petitioner thereafter filed an application under Article 32 of the Constitution challenging the validity of the order made against him. The order of confiscation was questioned on the ground that it did not give the petitioner an option to pay a fine in lieu of confiscation, as provided in Section 183 of the Sea Customs Act. The Imports and Exports (Control) Act, 1947 by Section 3(1) empowers the Central Government to make provisions for prohibiting,restricting or otherwise controlling, in all cases or in specified classes of cases, the import, export, carriage coastwise or shipment as ships' stores of goods of any specified description. Sub-section (2) of that Section provided that all goods to which any order under sub-section (1) applies shall be deemed to be goods of which the import or export has been prohibited or restricted under section 19 of the Sea Customs, 1878, and all the provisions of that Act shall have effect accordingly, except that section 183 thereof shall have effect as if for the word \"shall\" therein the word \"may\" was substituted. It was held that the goods imported into India contrary to the prohibition or restriction shall be liable to confiscation and any person concerned in such importation shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding three times the value of the goods or not exceeding one thousand rupees. Under Section 167(8) of the Sea Customs Act the provisions of confiscation of goods illegally imported are mandatory. The only question adjudicated before this Court was that as no option was given to pay fine in lieu of confiscation u/s 183 of the Sea Customs Act, the order should be held bad. It was held that in view of the substitution of the word 'may' in place of 'shall' in Section 183 of the Sea Customs Act, it has been left to the discretion of the Customs Authorities to give or not to give the option to payfine. It was held that it was obligatory on the part of the Customs Authorities to make an order confiscating the goods illegally imported in violation of the provisions of the Act. The objects and reasons of the M.Z.I. Act are to prevent illegal poaching of fishes by foreign vessels chartered by Indian citizens in the exclusive economic zone of India at a depth less than 40 fathoms by providing deterrent punishment for contravention of the provisions of the Act in order to protect and safeguard the interests of India fishermen. Chapter II of the Act deals with Regulation of fishing by foreign vessels. The heading of Section 3 is \"Prohibiting of Fishing in Maritime Zones of India by Foreign Vessels\". Thus Section 3 prohibits the use of foreign vessels for fishing within any maritime zone of India without licence or permit granted by the Central Government and also in accordance with the terms mentioned in the licence or permit. Section 5 under the caption 'Prohibition of Fishing by Indian Citizens' using foreign vessels clearly enjoins in sub-section 6 that a person holding permit shall ensure that every person employed by him complies, in the course of such employment with the provisions of the act or any rule or order made thereunder and the conditions of such permit.Rule 8(1) (q) inserted by M.Z.I Rules as amended in 1982 expressely prohibits fishing by foreign vessel chartered by Indian citizens in a depth less than 40 fathoms in any exclusive economic zone of India. Infringement of this rule as well as violation of the provisions of Section 5 of the Act and the conditions of permit will make the masters of the vessel as well as the company and the Managing Director or Secretary of the Company chartering the vessel liable to conviction and sentence of penalty expressly provided in section 12 of the said Act. Section 13 also in clear and unambiguous terms says that on the conviction of the person i.e. the master and the charterer of an offence under Sections 10 or 11 or 12 the vessel used in connection with the offence together with the fish on board such ship or the sale proceeds of the sale of such fish, stores, cargo shall also be liable to confiscation. Viewed in the context the words \"shall also be liable to confiscation\" do not leave any discretion to the Magistrate or the court to make no order of confiscation of the vessel as soon as the masters of the vessel are convicted u/s 10 or 11 or 12 of the said Act. The Legislative intent in making this provision is to provide deterrent punishment to prohibit fishing in exclusive economic zone of India by foreign vessel in infringement of the Act and the rules framed thereunder and the conditions of permit or licence. Viewed in this context Section 13 mandates that on conviction of the master and charterer of an offence under Section 12 not only penalty of fine shall be imposed but the vessel used in or in connection with the commission of such offence has to be confiscated. It is not open to the Court to consider the graveness of the offence and other extenuating circumstances and to make no order for confiscation of the offending vessel concerned. Confiscation of the vessel is the immediate statutory consequence of the finding that an offence either under Section 10 or 11 or 12 has been proved and its master has been convicted. Section 13 is thus mandatory and it is not open to the court as soon as the masters of the vessel is convicted of an offence under Section 12 and is awarded penalty to refrain from making an order confiscating the offending vessel. For the reasons aforesaid we dismiss all these appeals and affirm the judgments and orders of the High Court. The vessels have been detained in Bombay Port after apprehending them on July 26, 1984 and a huge amount has to be paid as port charges. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case the Port Authorities at Bombay may consider if an application is made by the parties for exemption or partial exemption of the same favourably in view of the order of confiscation of the trawlers. There will be no order for costs. S.L.

Appeal from the judgment and decree dated October 14, 1958, of the Kerala High Court, Ernakulam in A. S. number 297 of 1955-E.M. K. Nambyar, S. N. Andley, Rameshwar Nath, P.L. Vohra, for the appellants. A. V. Viswanatha Sastri and Sardar Bahadur, for respondents numbers 1-3. 1962. May 3. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUDHOLKAR, J.-This is an appeal from a, decree of the High Court of Kerala by a certificate granted by it under Art. 133(1) of the Constitution. The appeal arises out of a suit instituted by a Karnavan of a tarwad along with two minor member of the tarwad for setting aside a registered assignment deed (hereafter referred to as sale deed) executed by his Mukthiar Karanakara Menon. who is junior member of the tarwad and by all the other adult member of the tarwad on 17.6.1117 (M.R.). We have not been able to ascertain the correct date according to the Gregorian calender; but it has been accepted before us that the document was executed in the month of February, 1942. Nothing, however. turns on the precise date of the execution of the document. This document is in fact a sale deed and thereunder certain property belonging to the tarwad was sold to the first defendant to the suit, who is appellant number 1 before us, for a consideration of Rupees 8,000. Out of the amount of Rupees 8,000, a sum of Rupees 5,250 was required for discharging the debt due under a mortgage decree against the tarwad. The grounds on which the sale is challenged by the plaintiffs are briefly theses : (1) That the sale outright of the suit proper. ties for Us. 8,000/- was not justified for satisfying the decretal debt of.Rupees 5,250 because the prevailing price of immovable property would be Rupees 46,000@/- or (2) That the sale was effected by a collusion between the first defend and the third defendant Karunakara Memnon who was the Mukhtiar of the plaintiff number 1. (3) That upon a proper construction of the power of attorney the Mukhtiar could execute a sale deed only if the Karnavan in his discretion thought it to be necessary for meeting the pressing needs or for the benefit of the tarwad to effect it and that as the Karnavan had not consented to the execution of the sale deed it is not binding upon the Tarwad. (4) That if the power of attorney is cons- trued as having vested in the third defendant with the discretion and Judgment of the Karnavan regarding' the necessity and expediency of alienting the tarwad property such a delegation is beyond the the powers of the Karnavan and would be void and imoperative, in law. An act purporting to be done under the colour of such authority is not valid and cannot bind the tarwad. (5) That the plaintiffs 2 and 3 were not represents by their legal guardian, that is, the Karnavan,and the purported representation by their mother the 5th defendant as their guardian .is in effective because she could not in law act as guardian in this transaction. The sale deed is, therefore, null and void. (6) That,the defendants 2, 4 and 5 who had joined in the sale deed had obviously done so on the footing that it was an intended conveyance of the rights of the taward and that if the deed is not legally effective to pass the rights of the tar wad as not being a valid act of the Karnavan, it cannot be regarded as having been intended to be executed by those three defendants. Further, that these defendants did not apply their minds, to the propriety or necessity of the transaction but were merely misled by the statements and representations of the third defendant as to the necessity for executing the deed. The transaction was challenged on three other minor grounds in the plaint but it is not necessary to refer to them because no arguments were advanced before is with regard to them. The first defendant who is a woman doctor contended that the transaction was valid and operative and was not liable to be get aside on any of the grounds on which it was challenged by the plaintiffs. She contended that apart from the decretal debt there were other outstanding debts of the tarwad which had to be satisfied and that the properties in the suit were attached in execution 'of a decree obtained against the tarwad in some other suit. The defendant believed, after making due enquiry and on the faith of the representations made by the assignors, that the whole of the amount of Rupees 8,000 was required for discharging debts binding on the tarwad, 'entered into the transaction bona fide. The price paid by her for the property was the prevailing market price for similar lands in the locality. Further, according to her, she had spent Rupees 8,000 after the purchase of the property for levelling the land and for strengthening the bonds. According to herit is because the value of the land has now gone up considerably that the plaintiffs and other members of the tarwad are attempting to defeat her just rights. Then again, according to her, on a proper construction of the power of attorney it would appear that the third defendant was authorised by the plaintiff number 1 as Karnavan to act on his behalf in all matters relating to the tarwad. She also contended that it was wrong to construe the power of attorney as amounting to a delegation of the whole of the power of the Karnavan. She, however, admitted that at the time of the execution of the sale deed it was not possible to get the written content of Karnavan, the plaintiff-number 1. Reference was made by her to several similar transactions entered into by the defendant number 3 in which the other adult members of the family has joined and it was pointed out that none of them has been challenged by the plaintiffs, suggesting thereby that they accepted the validity of transactions of a similar kind. The trial court held that the sale in favour of the first defendant was binding on the tarwad and dismissed the suit. It may be mentioned that in addition to the claim for possession of the property in the suit, the plaintiffs had asked for mesne profits. Naturally, that claim also was dismissed by the trial court in view of its finding on the main issue. For the same reason it did not give any finding on the question of improvements alleged to have been made by the first defendant. On appeal the High Court reversed the decree of the first court. Before the High Court the validity of the alienation was challenged on three grounds: (1) The non-joinder of the Karnavan in the execution of the sale deed- (2) The inadequacy of consideration for the transaction; (3) Want of legal necessity for the transaction. While it held that the sale was justified on the grounds of necessity and that the consideration was adequate, the High' Court came to the conclusion that the transaction was not binding on the tarwad because the Karnavan had not joined in it. According to the High Court the power of attorney executed by the first plaintiff on March 22, 1939 in favour of the third defendant cannot be effective as derogation to the third defendant of the first plaintiffs power with respect to the tarwad property and, therefore, the transaction must fail as an act of the tarwad. While reversing the decree of the trial court and decreeing the suit the High Court ordered that the plaintiff would be entitled to the possession of the property on depositing Rupees 8,000 which was the amount of consideration paid by defendant number 1 and of which the tarwad had received benefit and, in addition, depositing Rupees 2,530 in respect of the money spent by defendant number 1 for improving the property. The High Court, however, ordered that the plaintiffs would be entitled to mesne profits from the date of suit at 1200 pares of paddy per annum till recovery of possession. It is not contended before as on behalf of the plaintiffs- respondents that the transaction was not supported by necessity or that the consideration was inadequate and, therefore, the only question which we have to consider in relation to the validity of the transaction is whether it was competent for the defendant number 3, acting as the Mukhtiar of the Karnavan, to effect the sale in association with the other adult members of the tarwad. On this part of the ease the contention of Mr. N. K. Nam biar for the appellants who axe defendant number 1 anddefendant number 6, a person cultivating the lands under the defendant number 1, are these: (1) Where all members of the tarwad join in the execution of a sale deed the question of delegation by the Karnavan does not arise. (2) Where a Karnavan challenges a sale on the ground that his Mukhtiar had not obtained his consent for effecting it that sale cannot be set aside unless the Karnavan proves the terms of the power of attorney and also proves that he did not assent to the transaction. (3) When a Karnavan impugns a sale because it was effected by virtue of a power of attorney which according to him amounts to a delegation of his powers as Karnavan the sale cannot be, set aside unless the power of attorney is itself produced. The last two grounds are based upon the fact that the power of attorney has not been produced in this case and no explanation is given for its nonproduction. It would appear from the averments made by the defendant in the written statement that she had taken out summonses both against the plaintiff number 1 and defendant number 3 to produce the power of attorney in court but they neither produced it nor made a statement on the point. Relying upon certain passages in the late Mr. Justice Sundara Aiyar's ','Treatise on Malabar and Aliyasanthana Law\" (1922 ed.) Mt. Nambiar contended that where all the members of the tarwad join in transaction that transaction is binding on the tarwad. A Karnavan is of course entitled to alienate the tarwad property for family necessity but where a transaction is entered into by all the member of the tarwad, the existence of suchnecessity need not be established. This, according to Mr. Nambiar, is the common law of Malabar. The family being resident in that part of Kerala which was formerly part of the Province of Madras, is governed by the common law as modified by statute. The main statute bearing on the point is the Madras Marumakkattayam Act, 1932 (Madras Act. number XXII of 1933). This Act has been amended by some later Madras Acts and Central Acts but with those amendments we are not concerned in this appeal. Under the common law of the Karnavan had complete power of alienating the tarwad property for necessity and in this regard he was the sole judge of the necessity. Section 33 of the Act, however, restricts that power and provides that for certain transactions, including a sale for the tarwad's necessity or benefit, the written consent of the majority of the major members of the tarwad must be obtained by the Karnavan. According to Mr. Nambiar this provision does not in any way derogate from the right of all the members of the tarwad acting together to partition the tarwad property amongst themselves or to alienate it any manner they choose. Thus according to him, s.33 of the Act deals only partly with the subject of' alienation of tarwad property and not the whole of it. Under the common law, according to him, property belonging to a Tarwad is the property of all the male and female members composing it and that the Karnavan has no greater personal right in the property than the junior members thereof In fact the family consists of individuals with equal rights. No doubt the Karnavan has the exclusive right to manage the tarwad property but his power is no more than that of a manager of a Mitakshara family. Nor again. does the property vest in the manager alone but in all the members of the familyor the tarwad. The right of the Karnavan to manage the family property is also subject to regulation by the common consent of all the members of the family and that family karars restricting the rights of the Karnavan are a common feature in Malabar. Where a Karnavan's rights are so restricted by common consent which necessarily includes his own consent-he cannot ordinarily dispute the binding effect of the karar upon him. The occasion for the execution of the power of attorney by the first plaintiff was admittedly the fact that the Karnavan left his native place for Borneo where he had taken up an appointment. The senior anandaravan in the Tarwad was defendant number 2 but he was holding a post with the Madras Government which required his being away from the family house during the whole of his service. Karunakara Menon, the third defendant was next in seniority and as be was residing in the family house the first plaintiff Achuta Menon executed the power of attorney in his favour. We may incidentally mention that Leelavathi Amma the 5th defendant in suit is the wife, of one Dr. P. B. Menon of Calicut and as she lives with him there she could not have been able to look after the family property. Nor again could the fourth defendant Govinda Menon attend to the work because he was also employed elsewhere. The family was clearly in difficulties and, therefore, according to Mr. Nambiar, it was essential for Achuta Menon to delegate as much authority to the person living in the family house as was permissible under law so as to enable him to manage the property in the beat interests of the Tarwad. It was for this reason that the power of attorney was executed in favour of Karunakara Menon, the third defendant. In its judgment the High Court has not said that there was no occasion for the execution ofpower of attorney. But according to it even by executing such power of attorney in favour of the third defendant it was not legally competent for the plaintiff number 1 to enable the third defendant to alienate family property except with his consent. The power of attorney not having been produced, the High Court considered the matter from two angles, full delegation and partial delegation, It first considered the matter on the assumption that the power of attorney conferred full power upon the defendant number 3 to act for the Karnavan, the plaintiff number 1, and alienate the property without reference to him. The High Court, after referring to certain decisions of the Madras High Court, came to the conclusion that such an empowerment by the Karnavan amounted to a delegation not only of his rights as a Karnavan but also of his duties to the tarwad and was, consequently, invalid in law. The High Court pointed out that where the power of attorney confers such wide powers on the Mukthiar, it is nothing but a delegation of the Karn- avans power and this is not permissible under the Marumakkattayam law which is the common law of Malabar. If, on the other hand, the delegation was not so extensive and if the power of attorney provided that the Mukthiar, the third defendant, was empowered to execute a sale deed on behalf of the tarwad as an agent of the Karnavan after ob- taining the consent of the Karnavan-here admittedly no such consent was obtained-the transaction must be deemed to be beyond the competence of the Mukthiar. It would be useful to consider the decisions in which some aspects of the question have been dealt with. In Cherukoman v. Ismala (1) Holloway J., who is regarded as an authority on Marumakkattayam law expressed the opinion that Karnavanship could, not be renounced. But his view has not been (1) (1871) 6 M.H. C.R. 145.accepted in Kenath Puthen Vittil Tavashi v. Narayanan(1). In the course of their judgment the Full Bench pointed out that there is nothing in principle in the position of the Karnavan opposed to renunciation by him of this office of Karnavan. They say that just as a trustee may renounce his trusteeship with the ;sanction of the court or assent of the beneficiaries a Karnavan, who, though he holds a fiduciary position and Yet is not a trustee, can also renounce. But since a Karnavan is not bound to render any account or to pay to the tarwad any surplus in his bands the reasons which exist in the case of a trustee to obtain the concurrence of the beneficiary before renouncing trust do not exist in the case of a Karnavan. Then they point out at p. 196, \"it is decidedly for the benefit of the tarwad that such power of renunciation should be recognised. An unwilling Karnavan usually makes a bad 'Manager.\" In conclusion they held that it will be open to a Karnavan of a tarwad to renounce his Karnavanship including his right to manage tarwad affairs. This view has not since been departed from. Though a Karnavan can thus renounce his office he cannot delegate or transfer that office. For, if he renounces his office the senior anandaravan has a right to succeed him as Karnavan and the rights of senior anandaravan would be jeoparadised if it were open to a Karnavan to transfer or delegate his office. If, therefore, a Karnavan delegates all his rights and obligations either to another members of the tarwad or to a stranger without reserving any power of revocation the Court will not give effect to such delegation as that would, amount to transfer of his office as a Karnavan. But. if it in possible to say that the delegation is not absolute in its character and is subject to. resumpt- ion by the Karnavan the courts would treat it merely as a power of attorney. (see Cherukorman (1) (1904) 28 Mad. 182. (2) (1871) 6 M.H.C.R. M. The question then is to what extent can a Karnavan delegate his right to manage the property to another. Referring to this question Muttusami Ayyar J., observed in Chappan' Nayar v. Assen Kutti \"There can be no doubt and it is not denied for the respondent, that karnavanship as recognised in Malabar is a birthright inherent in one's status as the senior male member of a tarwad. It is therefore a personal right and as such it cannot be assigned to a stranger either permanently or for a time. If it can be delegated at all, it is capable of delegation only to a member of the tarwad, the principle being that the de facto manager thereby assists the karnavan during his pleasure,. and is entitled to do so by reason of his connection with the tarwad and his interest in its property.\" Then referring to the document which fell to be construed in that case the learned Judge observed: \",If it is an assignment of the right of karnavanship, it, is void, though for a term only, on the ground. that, the delegate is not a member of the tarwad; if on,the other, hand it is a, power of attorney limited to manage- ment of specific property; as an agent subject to the general control of the karnavan, it may be valid on the ground, that the karnavanship is not the interest assigned or delegate.\" In that' case the, karnavan. of a Malahar tarwad having been sentenced to a term of imprisonment delegated to his son all his powers as karnavan for being exercised during the period he was serving his sentence. The High Court held that the delegation was ultra vires and void. having (1) (1889) I.L.R. 12 Mad. 219. been made in favour of a stranger. For, though the delegation was in favour of the son he was in fact member of his mothers tarwad and was, therefore, a stranger vis-a-vis his father's tarwad.Referring to this decision Seshagiri Ayyar J., observed in Krishnan Kidaya v. Raman (1) \"The karnavan has two capacities a temporal and a spiritual one. In the former he is the manager of the family properties, maintains the union members, represents the tarwad in transactions with strangers, etc: In his latter capacity he presides at the ceremonies and performs all the religious duties which are incumbent on him. A stranger cannot supplant him in this latter office: but I fail to see why his duties as manager could not be delegated to a stranger. If a receiver is appointed pending a suit for the removal of a karnavan, this officer will have all the rights of a karnavan so far as management is concerned. An agent who acts with the consent of all the members in managing the temporal affairs of a tarwad cannot be in a worse posit on.\" For these reasons he held that a family karar which gave the management to a person who had ceased to be a member of the tarwad was good and effective. This decision has been referred to by the learned Judges of the Kerala High Court in their Judgment under appeal but they have apparently regarded the observation of Seshagiri Ayyar as obiter. On the other hand they have placed reliance on the decision in K. Ramankutty Mennon V. geevi Umma (2). In that case the Karnavan of a tarwad executed a document in the first part of which he renounced his powers of management of the tarwad (1) (1916) I.L.R. 39 Mad. 918,920. (2) A.I.R. (1929) Mad. 286.and in the second part delegated them to two of the junior anandravans for a consideration of Rupees 500 and future maintenance. The document recited that the said anandravans were to act as the representatives of himself, the Karnovan. The High Court held that the document must be held to operate as either renouncing the Karnavan's powers or as delegating them. If it was the former it was invalid because it did not amount to an out-and out and unconditional renunciation, recognising the senior anandravan's rights of succession. If it was the latter it was invalid because a karnavan has no right to delegate his I powers. In support of its conclusion the High Court relied upon the decision in Chappan Nayar v. Assen Kutty (1) and distinguished the decision of the Full Bench in Kenath Puthen Vittil Tavashi v. Narayanan (2). No doubt, as a deed of renunciation the document was invalid. Under the document the joint managers would not become Karnavans but only be the Mukthiars of the Karnavan having the right to manage the Tarwad property. That the Karnavan's power of management can be restricted by a family karar cannot be disputed. (see P. K. Govindan Nair v. P. Narayanan Nair (3). It is however, not clear from the report whether the delegation by the Karnavan was by virtue of a family karar to which all members of the Tarwad were parties. The case is, therefore, distinguishable from the one before us. The view taken by Seshagiri Ayyar J., in Krishnan Kidava is case (4) is that the power of management could be transferred by the Karnavan with the consent of all the member of the Tarwad to another person so long of course as the transfer or delegation of power is revocable. According to the learned Judge a delegation of the power of (1) (1889) I.L.R. 12 Mad. 219, (2) (1904) I.L.R. 28 Mad. 182. (3) (1912) 23 M.L. J.706. (4) (1916) I.L.R. 39 Mad. 216.920. management in favour of even a stranger would be valid. This view is not in consonance with that taken in Chappan Nayar's case (1) which the learned Judge has not chosen to follow. It is also opposed to that taken in certain other cases., For the purposes of this case it is not necessary to say which of the two- views is correct because here delegation is in favour of an anandravan, though not the senior most anandravan. The decision referred to above thus recognise that by .,a family karar a Karnavan's power of management can be. restricted and also that a Karnavan's power of management can be delegated, so long as what is delegated is not the totality of the powers. enjoyed by a Karnavan by virtue of his status' The question then is whether it follows from this that a Karnavan's duties srising in connection with the management of the Tarwad can be delegated. One more concept of the Malabar law has to be borne in mind. The concept is that the properties belong to all the members of the Tarwad and that apart from the right of management the Karnavan has no larger right or interest than the other members. This is clear from the decision of Seshagiri Ayyar, J., in Govindan Nair's case (2) and the decisions referred to therein. By virtue of his status the Karnavan owes certain duties to the members of the Tarwad and one of such duties is to manage the properties .in the best interest of the members. Those to whom the duties are owed may find that in their own interest the duties can. be best, performed by an anandravan in pratioulax circumstances. These would be good reasons to justify the delegation of a Karnavan's power of management to an anandravan by a family karar and to uphold such karar. Thus where for some reason the karnavan is not able to, discharge his duties in ,respect of manage. (1) (1889) I.L.R. 12 Mad. 219. (2) ( 1912) 23 M.L.J. 706. ment of the tarwad property such as in the case before us, that is, where the Karnavan has left the country for an indefinite period or taken up a job in another country which would keep him away for years from his mother country there mast be someone who could look after the family property and who would have the power to manage it. If delegation of the Karnavan's power of management is regarded as incompetent the necessary result would be that the interests of the family would suffer. It is by no means a practical propo- sition to expect the family members to approach the Karnavan, when he is at some far off corner, for his consent in regard to each and every transaction, be it sale, mortgage or lease. Again it may be too expensive for the Karnavan to come all the way back to his native place whenever an occasion arises for alienating or encumbering the Tarwad property for family necessity. No recognised concept underlying , the. Marumakkattayam law will be violated by holding that an agreement or Karar entered into by the Karnavan and the members of the family by which the power of management of the tarwad carrying with it the duty to decide during the absence of the Karnavan whether a particular alienation should be effected for meeting a family necessity is delegated to Mukthiar so that he can exercise that power with the concurrence of the adult members during the absence of the Karnavan as and when occasion arises is a perfectly valid agreement. on the other hand to hold that this is permissible would be in consonance with the concept of joint ownership\" by all ,the members of the Taxwad properties and with the settled legal position that. the powers of a Karnavan could be restricted by,' the consent of all, Which, of course, includes the consent of the Karnavan himself The 'execution of a power of attorney of this kind would, in effect, be a restriction placed by a family karar on the power of the Karnavan. The delegation merely of a powerof management which is revocable cannot be regarded as a delegation of the office of the karnavan. The Karnavan continues to be Karnavan but during his absence from the spot his managerial powers are exercisable by the Mukthiar. After he returns he can resume the management and carry on the affairs of the tarwad. Or again, the delegation being through a power of attorney he can in a proper case put an end to it by revoking the power of attorney. Thus, despite the execution of such a power of attorney he does not fade out completely and, therefore, there is no question of its operating as renunciation. The power of attorney given by the plaintiff number '1 to defendant number 3 has quite clearly been suppressed by them and we are, therefore, entitled to infer from this fact that, if produced, it would have gone against the interests of the plaintiffs and other members of the tarwad. It would, therefore, be legitimate for us to assume that the power of attorney empowered the third defendant to sell family property with the consent of the other adult members of the family for family necessity if he formed the opinion that it was necessary to do so. The fact that plaintiff number 1 executed the power of-attorney before leaving for Borneo and thereafter several properties were alienated by the Mukthiar in conjunctions with the other anandravans and none of the alienations except the one in suit has been challenged by the plaintiff number 1 hi all these years justifies the inference that these dispositions were in pursuance of the power of attorney and also that the power of attorney was itself executed by the plaintiff number 1 in pursuance of a family karar. Upon this view, therefore the appeal must succeed. The appellants' costs shall throughout be borne by the plaintiffs respondents.

From the judgment and order dated the 1st, June 1972 of the Calcutta High Court in Appeal number 150 of 1971 arising out of Matter number 262 of 1968. Debi Pal, A.K. Verma and K.J. John for the Appellant. versus Desai, Champat Rai and Miss A. Subhashini for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI, J. This appeal by certificate is directed against an order passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Calcutta allowing an appeal against a decision of a Single Judge which quashed and set aside a notice dated 28th March 1968 issued by the Income Tax Officer under section 148 of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961 seeking to reopen the assessment of the assessee for the assessment year 1959-60. The facts giving rise to the appeal are a little important and they may be briefly stated as follows. Prior to March 1947, one Deo Datt Sharma carried on business in Delhi in the name of Sharma Trading Company. The business was quite a prosperous one and the record shows that Deo Datt Sharma was making an average profit of about Rupees 36,000 per year. In March 1947, the assessee was incorporated as a private limited company with Ganga Saran Sharma as its managing director and it took over the business of Sharma Trading Company as a going concern in consideration of allotment of 1703 shares in the share capital of the assessee to Deo Datt Shrama. The share capital of the assessee consisted of 8500 shares out of which 1703 shares were allotted to Deo Datt Sharma, 5 shares were held by Ganga Saran Sharma and 3500 shares, by a company called Narendra Trading Company controlled by Ganga Saran Sharma and his wife. It may be pointed out at this stage that Deo Datt Sharma was the brother-in-law of Ganga Saran Sharma. When business of Deo Datt Sharma was taken over by the assessee, Deo Datt Sharma was appointed Director of the assessee along with two other persons. Deo Datt Sharma was placed in charge of management of the business of Delhi Branch of the assessee and he was paid a salary of Rupees 1000 per month, commission at the rate of 1 per cent on the sales of the Delhi Branch and bonus equivalent to three months' salary. Ganga Saran Sharma and the other two directors were also paid salary, commission and bonus but it is not necessary to set out the quantum of the emoluments paid to them, because in this appeal we are concerned only with the emoluments paid to Deo Datt Sharma and not with the emoluments paid to other directors. The Income Tax Officer while assessing the assessee to tax for the assessment year 1949-50 disallowed the claim of the assessee for deduction in respect of payments made to the managing director and other directors on account of commission and bonus. On appeal by the assessee the Appellate Assistant Commissioner disagreed with the view taken by the Income Tax Officer and allowed the entire amount paid to the managing director and other directors by way of commission and bonus. So far as Deo Datt Sharma is concerned, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner observed that having regard to the fact that this very business was carried on by Deo Datt Sharma prior to its taking over by the assessee and it was a prosperous business earning on an average about Rupees 36,000 per year and after taking over of the business by the assessee, Deo Datt Sharma continued to be in sole management of thebusiness of the Delhi Branch, the aggregate amount paid to him could not at all be regarded as excessive and was allowable as a permissible deduction. Thus the entire amount paid by the assessee to the managing director and other directors was allowed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner as a deduction in computing the taxable income of the assessee. The assessee had thereafter no difficulty in claiming deduction of the amount paid to the managing director and other directors on account of salary, commission and bonus, but again in the assessment year 1956- 57, the Income Tax Officer disallowed a substantial portion of the remuneration paid to the managing director and the assessment made by the Income Tax Officer was confirmed in appeal by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and in further appeal by the Income Tax Tribunal. This led to the making of a reference and the High Court answered the question referred to it in favour of the assessee and held that the disallowance of a portion of the remuneration paid to the managing director was not justified. While making the assessment for the assessment year 1957-58, the Income Tax Officer once again disallowed a part of the remuneration paid to the managing director as also the amounts of interest paid to the directors on the balances lying to the credit of their respective accounts with the assessee on account of undrawn remuneration. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner in appeal held that the interest paid to the directors on the balances lying to the credit of their respective accounts was an allowable expenditure but he sustained the disallowance of a portion of the remuneration paid to the managing director. The assessee thereupon preferred a further appeal to the Tribunal and after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case, the Tribunal came to the conclusion that the remuneration paid to the managing director as also to the other directors was not at all excessive and no portion of it could justifiably be disallowed. The result was that not only was the remuneration paid to the managing director and the other directors allowed in full as a permissible deduction but also the amount of interest paid on the credit balances in their respective accounts was allowed to be deducted as a permissible expenditure. Obviously, and this could not be disputed on behalf of the Revenue, the accounts of the managing director and other directors including Deo Datt Sharma showing the amount of remuneration credited and the withdrawals debited in each year were produced before the Income Tax Officer and he was aware that only a very small amount was withdrawn by Deo Datt Sharma out of the remuneration credited in his account. Therecord also shows that on a query made by the Income Tax Officer the assessee furnished inter alia the assessment file number of Deo Datt Sharma who was being assessed in Delhi. The assessment for the assessment year 1958-59 also followed the same course upto the stage of appeal before the Income Tax Tribunal and ultimately the amount of interest paid to the directors on the credit balances in their respective accounts was allowed as a permissible deduction to the assessee. The assessment of the assessee for the subsequent year 1959-60 was thereafter completed on the basis of the decision of the Income Tax Tribunal for the two earlier assessment years and the amounts paid to the managing director and other directors including Deo Datt Sharma by way of salary, commission and bonus were allowed in full as permissible deductions and so was the interest paid on the credit balances in their respective accounts. On 28th March, 1968 the Income Tax Officer issued a notice under section 148 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 seeking to reopen the assessment of the assessee for the assessment year 1959-60 on the ground that the income of the assessee had escaped assessment at the time of the original assessment. Since a period of four years had already elapsed from the close of the assessment year 1959-60 and no notice could be issued under section 147 (b), it was obvious that the notice issued by the Income Tax Officer was based on section 147 (a), and it could be justified only if it could be shown that the Income Tax Officer had reason to believe that, by reason of omission or failure on the part of assessee to disclose any material facts, the income of the assessee had escaped assessment. The Income Tax Officer however did not indicate in the notice as to what were the reasons which had led him to believe that the income of the assessee had escaped assessment by reason of omission or failure to disclose material facts nor did he give any reasons though requested by the assessee to do so. The assessee thereupon preferred a writ petition in the High Court of Calcutta challenging the validity of the notice on the ground that there was no omission or failure on the part of the assessee to disclose any material facts at the time of the original assessment and that in any event, there was no reason to believe that any part of the income of the assessee had escaped assessment by reason of such omission or failure. The writ petition was admitted and rule was issued by a single Judge of the Calcutta High Court. The Income Tax Officer, possibly on service of the rule, addressed a letter dated 19th June 1968 to the assessee stating thatthe notice was issued by him because he had reason to believe that the payment of remuneration to Deo Datt Sharma was bogus and false. The Income Tax Officer also stated in the affidavit filed by him in reply to the writ petition that after the assessment of the assessee was completed for the assessment years upto 1963-64, the Income Tax Officer came to learn that Deo Datt Sharma was the brother-in-law of Ganga Saran Sharma, managing director and that Deo Datt Sharma had disposed of the income received by him by way of remuneration from the assessee, in the following manner: 1. On 31st July 1957 he made a gift to Shri Narendra Sharma son of Shri Ganga Saran Sharma, Managing Director of the Company. Rupees 12,550.00 2. On 25th August 1958 he made a loan to Ganga Saran Sharma. Rupees 2,25,000.00 --------------- Total 2,37,550.00 --------------- and thereafter, out of the amount lying to his credit in the account with the assessee, he had made the following gifts: On 5th December 1960 gift to Brahma Devi wife of Ganga Saran Sharma Rupees 1,01,101.00 On 21st December 1960 gift to Indu Sharma daughter-in-law of Ganga Saran Sharma Rupees 15,101.00 On 26th December 1961 gift to Hemlata Sharma daughter-in-law of Ganga Saran Sharma. Rupees 50,101.00 The Income Tax Officer stated that out of the total amount of remuneration of Rupees 3,51,000 received by Deo Datt Sharma during the period upto 31st March 1962, he had paid tax in the sum of about Rupees 65,000 and spent a total sum of Rupees 2,37,550 on account of gifts and loan as aforesaid and the withdrawals made by him for his own purposes thus did not amount to more than Rupees 4000 per year. These facts, according to the Income Tax Officer, showed that the remuneration paid to Deo Datt Sharma was not genuine and was sham and bogus and the amount of such remuneration alleged to have been paid to Deo Datt Sharma was wrongly allowed as a permissible deduction and hence the assessment of the assessee was liable to be reopened by issue of a notice under section 147 (a). The learned single Judge of the Calcutta High Court who heard the writ petition took the view that there was no omission or failure on the part of the assessee to disclose any material facts relating to his assessment and that in any event, there was no reason to believe that any part of the income of the assessee had escaped assessment at the time of the original assessment by reason of wrong allowance of the remuneration paid to Deo Datt Sharma as a permissible deduction. The writ petition was accordingly allowed by him and the notice issued by the Income Tax officer was quashed and set aside. The Income Tax Officer thereupon preferred an appeal before a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court and the learned Judges constituting the Division Bench allowed the appeal, holding that the Income Tax Officer had reason to believe that the amount of remuneration paid to Deo Datt Sharma had been wrongly allowed as a permissible deduction by reason of omission or failure on the part of the assessee to disclose the material facts set out above and the notice issued by the Income Tax Officer was justified. The assessee thereupon preferred the present appeal in this Court after obtaining a certificate of fitness from the High Court of Calcutta. It is well settled as a result of several decisions of this Court that two distinct conditions must be satisfied before the Income Tax Officer can assume jurisdiction to issue notice under section 147 (a). First, he must have reason to believe that the income of the assessee has escaped assessment and secondly, he must have reason to believe that such escapement is by reason of the omission or failure on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment. If either of these conditions is not fulfilled, the notice issued by the Income Tax Officer would be without jurisdiction. The important words under section 147 (a) are \"has reason to believe\" and these words are stronger than the words \"is satisfied\". The belief entertained by the Income Tax Officer must not be arbitrary or irrational. It must be reasonable or in other words it must be based on reasons which are relevant and material. The Court, of course, cannot investigate into the adequacy or sufficiency of the reasons whichhave weighed with the Income Tax Officer in coming to the belief, but the Court can certainly examine whether the reasons are relevant and have a bearing on the matters in regard to which he is required to entertain the belief before he can issue notice under section 147 (a). It there is no rational and intelligible nexus between the reasons and the belief, so that, on such reasons, no one properly instructed on facts and law could reasonably entertain the belief, the conclusion would be inescapable that the Income Tax Officer could not have reason to believe that any part of the income of the assessee had escaped assessment and such escapement was by reason of the omission or failure on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts and the notice issued by him would be liable to he struck down as invalid. Now here on the facts as admitted or found it is clear that Deo Datt Sharma was carrying on the same business prior to the incorporation of the assessee as a private limited company and this business was yielding him an average profit of about Rupees 36000 per year. When the assessee, on incorporation, took over the business as a going concern from Deo Datt Sharma it appointed Deo Datt Sharma as a director and placed him in sole charge of the management of the Delhi Branch of the business. In fact, it could not be disputed on behalf of the Revenue that Deo Datt Sharma was looking after the business of the Delhi Branch of the assessee in the same manner in which he was doing when he was sole proprietor of the business and for this work done by him, Deo Datt Sharma was paid salary at the rate of Rupees 1000 per month, commission at the rate of one per cent on the sales of the Delhi Branch and bonus equivalent of three months' salary. The amount of remuneration paid to Deo Datt Sharma was thus not without consideration; in fact, it was paid for valuable services rendered by Deo Datt Sharma in solely managing the business of the Delhi Branch of the assessee. Now once it is conceded that Deo Datt Sharma was in sole charge and management of the business of the Delhi Branch of the assessee and was rendering full time service to the assessee in that capacity, it is difficult to see how any one could reasonably come to the belief that the payment of remuneration made to him was sham and bogus. Surely, the Income Tax officer could not expect Deo Datt Sharma to devote his full time and energy to the business of the Delhi Branch of the assessee without any remuneration whatsoever. The actual remuneration paid to Deo Datt Sharma was in fact found to be genuine and reasonable by the Appellate Assistant Commissionerwhile disposing of the appeal of the assessee for the assessment year 1949-50 as also by the Income Tax Tribunal while disposing of the appeal for the assessment year 1957- 58. It is true that Deo Datt Sharma was the brother-in-law of Ganga Saran Sharma, the managing director of the assessee, but this circumstance cannot by any stretch of imagination lead to an inference that the payment of remuneration to Deo Datt Sharma who was solely managing and looking after the business of the Delhi Branch of the assessee was sham and bogus. Even a close relative who is in management and charge of a business on a full time basis is entitled to be paid remuneration and, in fact, it would be wholly unreasonable to expect him to work free of charge. The Revenue, however, relied strongly on the fact that out of the total amount of remuneration of Rupees 3,51,000 received by Deo Datt Sharma and credited to his account with the assessee, he had not withdrawn more than Rupees 4,000 per year for himself and an aggregate sum of Rupees 2,37,550 was expended by him in giving a loan to Ganga Saran Sharma and making gifts to the son, wife and daughters-in-law of Ganga Saran Sharma on diverse dates between 31st July, 1957 and 26th December 1961. We fail to see how this fact can lend itself to the inference that the payment of remuneration to Deo Datt Sharma was bogus and not genuine. It is an admitted fact that Deo Datt Sharma was the brother-in-law of Ganga Saran Sharma and there is nothing unusual in Deo Datt Sharma giving a loan to Ganga Saran Sharma or making gift to the son, wife and daughters-in-law of Ganga Saran Sharma who were his close relatives. It is indeed difficult to appreciate how any inference can reasonably be drawn that the payment of remuneration to Deo Datt Sharma was sham and bogus merely from the manner in which he expended the amount of remuneration received by him, particularly when the persons to whom he gave a loan and made gifts were his close relatives. It is possible that Deo Datt Sharma had other financial resources apart from the remuneration derived by him from the assessee and he therefore decided to give a loan and make gifts to his close relatives out of the remuneration received by him for valuable services rendered to the assessee. In fact, if he had no other financial resources, it is extremely difficult-one might say, almost impossible-to believe that he worked for the assessee and managed and looked after the business of the Delhi Branch on a full time basis without any remuneration or in any event on apaltry remuneration of Rupees 4,000 per year when the managing director and other directors who were working like him were getting much more from the assessee and as the proprietor of the business prior to its taking over by the assessee, he was earning an average profit of about Rupees 36,000 per year. We are clearly of the view that on these facts the Income Tax Officer could have no reason to believe that the payment of remuneration to Deo Datt Sharma was sham and bogus and that the amount of remuneration paid to him was wrongly allowed as a permissible deduction. We may point out that, in fact, the statement of account of Deo Datt Sharma with the assessee for the relevant accounting year as also the previous years were with the Income Tax Officer at the time of the original assessment and these statements of account clearly showed that out of the amount of remuneration credited to his account, he had made a gift of Rupees 12,550 to the son of Ganga Saran Sharma on 31st July 1957 and given a loan of Rupees 2,25,000 to Ganga Saran Sharma on 25th August, 1958 and the Income Tax Officer was fully aware that Ganga Saran Sharma was the managing director of the assessee. It is possible and we may assume it in favour of the Revenue, that the subsequent gifts made by Deo Datt Sharma to the wife and daughters-in-law of Ganga Saran Sharma were not disclosed to the Income Tax Officer at the time of the original assessment, but these gifts being subsequent to the relevant accounting year, the assessee was not bound to disclose the same to the Income Tax Officer. Moreover, it is difficult to appreciate how the assessee could be said to be under an obligation to disclose to the Income Tax Officer in the course of its assessment as to how a director who was in sole charge of the management of the business of the assessee and who was being paid remuneration for the services rendered by him to assessee, had utilised the amount of remuneration received by him. We do not think it possible to sustain the conclusion that the assessee omitted or failed to disclose fully and truly any material facts relating to his assessment."}, "annotations": [{"result": [{"value": {"start": 0, "end": 63, "text": "CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal number 1146 of 1973.", "labels": ["NONE"]}}, {"value": {"start": 64, "end": 214, "text": "From the judgment and order dated the 1st, June 1972 of the Calcutta High Court in Appeal number 150 of 1971 arising out of Matter number 262 of 1968.", "labels": ["NONE"]}}, {"value": {"start": 215, "end": 268, "text": "Debi Pal, A.K.

Civil Appeal number 30 of 1957. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated September 1, 1955, of the Bombay High Court in Income-tax Reference number 37 of 1952. N. A. Palkhivala and I. N. Shroff, for the appellant. K. N. Rajagopala Ayyangar and D. Gupta, for the respondent. 1960. December 7. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by HIDAYATULLAH, J.-The Raghuvanshi Mills Ltd., Bombay (a public limited Company), has filed this appeal by special leave against the judgment and orders of.the High Court of Bombay dated March 10, 1953, and September 1, 1955. By the first order, the Bombay High Court directed the Income-tax Tribunal to submit a supplementary statement in the case in the light of its judgment, giving the parties liberty to lead further evidence, if any. By the second order, the High Court re-framed the question, and answered it against the assessee. The assessee Company's issued and subscribed capital was, at the material time, Rupees 10,00,000 divided into 10,000 shares of Rupees 100 each. Prior toNovember 14, 1941, one Maganlal Parbhudas, who was a Director of the Company, held 6,344 shares. On November 14, 1941, he made a gift of 1,000 shares to each of his five sons, Ravindra, Surendra, Bipinchandra, Hareshchandra and Krishnakumar. We are concerned with the account year of the Company, April 1, 1942, to March 31, 1943, the assessment year being 1943-44. In that year, the dividend which was declared at the Annual General Meeting held on December 17, 1943, was less than what was required under section 23A of the Indian Income-tax Act. The question, therefore, arose whether the Company could be said to be one to which s. 23A(1) of the Act was applicable, regard being had to the third proviso and the Explanation under it. During the accounting period, the Company had eight Directors, whose names along with the shares respectively held by them are given below: Shares (1) Shri Maganlal Parbhudas 1,344 (2) Ravindra Maganlal 1,168 (3) Surendra Maganlal... 1,100 (4) Amritlal Chunilal (jointly with Babulal Chunilal)... 833 (5) Babulal Chunilal.... 100 (6) Bhagwandas Harakchand.... 50 (7) Haridas Purshottam.. 50 (8) Sir Chunilal B. Mehta (jointly with Lady Tapibai Chunilal) 50 ----------- Total 4,695 ----------------- Out of the balance of the shares, 4,754 shares were held by the relatives of some of the above-named Directors, as stated below: Shares (1) Shrimati Kantabai Maganlal (wife of a Director) 771 (2) Shri Bipinchandra Maganlal 1,000 (3) Shri Hareshchandra Maganlal (son of a Director) 1,000 (4) Shri Krishnakumar Maganlal (do) 1,000 (5) Shrimati Dhanlaxmi Mohanlal (6) Srimati Prabhavati Nanalal Harilal (5 and 6 daughters of a Director) 50 (7) Shri Hirjibhai Purshottam and Haridas Purshottam (brothers of a Director) 25 (8) Shri Dhanjibhai Purshottam and Haridas Purshottam (brothers of a Director) 25 (9) Shri Chimanlal Vithaldas (cousin of a Director) 833 ------------ Total 4,754 --------------- The remaining 551 shares were held by the members of the public, who were not connected with the Directors of the Company in any way. Before March, 1942, Messrs. Ravindra Maganlal and Bros. were the Managing Agents of the Company. Maganlal Parbhudas was the sole proprietor of that firm. On March 7, 1942, the Company appointed Ravindra Maganlal & Co. Ltd. as the Managing Agents for. a period of 20 years. The Managing Company had a total issued and subscribed capital of Rupees 5,000 and the five sons of Maganlal Parbhudas who have been named before had subscribed that capital equally. During the account year, Maganlal Parbhudas and two of his sons, Ravindra Maganlal and Surendra Maganlal, were three of the Directors of the Company. Ravindra, Surendra and Bipinchandra were Directors of the Managing Company. On these facts, the Income-tax Officer applied section 23A (as it stood prior to its amendment by the Finance Act, 1955) to the Company, holding that this was not a Company in which the public were substantially interested. The order of the Income-tax Officer was confirmed on appeal, both by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the Tribunal. The Tribunal also refused to state a case under section 66(1) of the Incometax Act, but the High Court of Bombay acting under section 66(2) called for a statement of the case on the question: \"Whether on the facts and circumstances of the982 case the provisions of section 23A of the Indian Income-tax Act (XI of 1922) are applicable to the petitioners?\" In stating the cases the Tribunal pointed out that probably the question ought to have been: \"Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case 1,000 shares each held by Bipinchandra, Haresh chandra and Krishnakumar in the capital of the assessee Company are held by members of the public within the meaning of the Explanation to the third proviso to section 23A?\" The members of the Tribunal in deciding the appeal before them, gave slightly different reasons. According to the Accountant Member, the shares held by persons interested in the Managing Company were under the control of the Directors of the appellant Company, and those persons could not be considered to be members of the public. The Judicial Member held that the Directors were controlling the shareholders of the Company, that their relatives were mere nominees, whose voting power was controlled by the Directors, and that the public could not, therefore, be said to be substantially interested, as required by the Explanation to the third proviso to the section. When the High Court heard the case, the learned Judges addressed themselves to the question, what was the proper meaning of the expression \"held by the public\" in the Explanation. They came to the conclusion that the object of the third proviso and the Explanation was that the voting power to be exercised by the public should be independent of the control of the Directors, and that the word \"Public\" was used in contradistinction to the Directors. They apparently thought that a holding by a Director could not be described, in any event, as a holding by the public. The High Court came to the tentative opinion that both the tests stated by the Accountant Member and the Judicial Member were incorrect, and held that what the law required was de facto control, 4 c a control which is, in fact, exercised,\" and that no finding appeared to have been given on that point by the Tribunal. The case was accordingly remitted tothe Tribunal for submission of a fresh statement of the case whether the Directors were exercising de facto control. over any of the other shareholders, who belonged to the second category mentioned by us above. The Tribunal thereupon re- stated the case, and after examining further evidence, gave the finding that the Directors, particularly the three sons of Maganlal Parbhudas who formed the Directors of the Managing Company were under the de facto control of their father. At no stage in the case did the Tribunal alter the finding reached by the Department that the shares of the Company were not, in fact, freely transferable by the holders to members of the public. The High Court then reheard the case, and came to the conclusion that there was evidence on which the Tribunal could hold that Maganlal Parbhudas exercised de facto control over his three sons. In view of this finding, the High Court held that the order made by the Tribunal was correct, and answered the question in the negative, re- framing it as follows: \"Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case the shares held by Bipinchandra, Harishchandra and Krishnakumar can be considered to be shares held by members of the public within the meaning of the explanation to the third proviso to Section 23A?\" The High Court refused to grant a certificate; but the Company has obtained special leave from this Court, and has filed this appeal. It is first contended that the test that the shares held by the Directors of a company are not shares in which the public are substantially interested is incorrect. According to learned counsel, all the authorities, the Tribunal and the High Court have proceeded on this wrong assumption, and have failed to apply the proper test laid down by the Explanation to the third proviso. It may be pointed out that there is no dispute that 551 shares, were, in fact, held by the public. The total shares of the Company being 10,000, the Company can only avoid the application of s. 23A, if the public hold shares carrying not less than 25 per cent. of the voting power, that is to say, 2,500 shares. The Directors between them hold 4,695 shares. Thesehave been held by the High Court to be shares, which cannot be said to be beneficially held by the public. Even so, if the rest of the shares can be said to be held by the public, then the minimum 25 per cent. would still be reached. It was in this context that the shares of the sons of Maganlal, Bipinchandra, Harishchandra and Krishnakumar, were considered. If those shares can be said to fall outside the category of shares beneficially held by the public, then those shares along with the shares held by the Directors reduced the number of shares held by the remaining shareholders to less than 25 per cent. It was on this view that the case was remitted to the Tribunal by the High Court to obtain a further statement whether Maganlal Parbhudas was de facto controlling these three shareholders. Two questions, therefore, arise in this appeal. The first is whether the shares held by the Directors must always be regarded as not held by the public. The second is what is the meaning of the provision: \"a company shall be deemed to be a company in which the public are substantially interested, if its shares carrying not less than twenty-five per cent. of the voting power have been allotted unconditionally to, or acquired unconditionally by, and are at the end of the previous year beneficially held by the public.\" In this connection, we may point out that a ruling of the Privy Council appears to take a different view from that taken by the High Court, in regard to an Uganda Ordinance in pari materia with the proviso and the Explanation. We shall refer to that case as also to a case of the House of Lords, where also a different conclusion in law from that of the High Court has been reached. Section 23A (as it stood prior to its amendment in 1955), omitting the portions not material, read as follows: \"23A. Power to assess individual members of certain companies.-Where the Income-tax Officer is satisfied that in respect of any previous year the profits and gains distributed as dividends by any company up to the end of the sixth month after its accounts for thatprevious year are laid before the company in general meeting are less than sixty per cent. of the assessable income of the company of that previous year, as reduced by the amount of income-tax and super-tax payable by the company in respect thereof he shall, unless he is satisfied that having regard to losses incurred by the company in earlier years or to the smallness of the profit made, the payment of a divi- dend or a larger dividend than that declared would be unreasonable, make with the previous approval of the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner an order in writing that the undistributed portion of the assessable income of the company of that previous year as computed for income-tax purposes and reduced by the amount of income-tax and super- tax payable by the company in respect thereof shall be deemed to have been distributed as dividends amongst the shareholders as at the date of the general meeting aforesaid, and thereupon the proportionate share thereof of each shareholder shall be included in the total income of such shareholder for the purpose of assessing his total income: ........................................ Provided further that this sub-section shall not apply to any company in which the public are substantially interested or to a subsidiary company of such a company if the whole of the share capital of such subsidiary company is held by the parent company or by the nominees thereof. Explanation.-For the purpose of this sub-section a company shall be deemed to be a company in which the public are substantially interested if shares of the company carrying not less than twentyfive per cent. of the voting power have been allotted unconditionally to, or acquired unconditionally by, and are at the end of the previous year beneficially held by the public...... and if any such shares have in the course of such previous year been the subject of dealings in any stock exchange or are in fact freely transferable by the holders to other members of the public.\" It is clear from the third proviso that the sub-sectiondoes not apply to a company in which the public are substantially interested. The Explanation lays down, among the tests, the minimum interest which can be called substantial' by saying that shares of the company carrying not less than 25 per cent. of the voting power must be allotted unconditionally to, or acquired unconditionally by, the public and they must be beneficially held by the public. The essence of the Explanation lies not in the percentage which only shows the limit of the minimum holding by the public, but lies in the words \"unconditionally\" and \"beneficially\". These words underline the fact that no person who holds a share or shares not for his own benefit but for the benefit of another and who does not exercise freely his voting power, can be said to belong to that body, which is designated 'public'. The word 'Public' is used in contradistinction to one or more persons who act in unison and among whom the voting power constitutes a block. If such a block exists and possesses more than seventy-five per cent. of the voting power, then the company cannot be said to be one in which the public are substantially interested. In Sardar Baldev Singh v. The Commissioner of Income-tax, Delhi and Ajmer (1), this Court took the following view: \"The section thus applies to a company in which at least 75 per cent. of the voting power lies in the hands of persons other than the public, which can only mean, a group of persons allied together in the same interest. The company would thus have to be one which is controlled by a group. The group can do what it likes with the affairs of the company, of course, within the bounds of the Companies Act. It lies solely in its hands to decide whether a dividend shall be declared or not.\" judged from the test we have indicated, it is clear that such a group may be formed by the Directors of a company acting in concert, or by some Directors acting in concert with others or even by some , shareholder or shareholders, none of whom may be a Director. Such a group which may, for convenience, be (1) [1961] 1 S.C.R. 482.designated a block, must hold a controlling interest, and if the voting power of the block is 75 per cent. or more, then obviously it can do anything at a meeting, whether general or special. When a company starts, the promoters may subscribe a portion of its capital and release the other unconditionally to the public. This is a case of unconditional allotment of shares to the public. The public may also unconditionally acquire a portion of the shares which were previously held by the group which promoted the company. If at the end of the previous year 25 per cent. or more of the voting power is so held by the public, the company can take the benefit of the third proviso. But if more than 75 per cent. of shares have again passed into the hands of a group which acts as a block, the third proviso ceases to apply. In deciding if there is such a controlling interest, there is no formula applicable to all cases. Relationship and position as Director are not by themselves decisive. If relatives act, not freely, but with others, they cannot be said to belong to that body, which is described as 'public' in the Explanation. But it would be otherwise if they were free. Similarly, if Directors or some of them do not act as a body or in concert with others, the fact that they are Di- rectors is of no significance. The case of Tatem Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue (2) illustrates the first proposition. There, the assessing Commissioners had made directions under section 21 of the Finance Act, 1922, against which the Company appealed on the ground that it was a Company in which the public were substantially interested, inasmuch as shares of the Company carrving not less than 25 percent. of the voting power had been allotted unconditionally to or acquired unconditionally by, and were, at the end of the relevant periods, beneficially held by the public and the decision of the Special Commissioners that 16,000 shares given by Lord Glanely to his niece were not allotted to or acquired by the public and that the Company was, therefore, not (1) (1941) 24 T.C. 57.a Company in which the public were \"substantially interested\" was erroneous. It was held by Lawrence, J., that merely because she was a niece of Lord Glanely did not make her cease to be a member of the public. The Court of Appeal agreed with Lawrence, J. No doubt, there were other provisions which laid down the kind of relationship which would lead to the inference that the holder was controlled by another, and a niece was not such a relative. The Act we are considering did not lay down the kind of relationship which would show such a control, and the same principle will apply. Mere relationship thus is not of consequence, unless control of the voting power held by such a relative, by another relative, is proved. The other test adopted in the case by the Bombay High Court that Directors stand outside the 'public' is also not decisive. In Commissioner of Income-tax v. H. Bjordal (1), the Judicial Committee dealt with section 21(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance number 8 of 1940 (Uganda), as amended by section 5 of the Income Tax (Amendment) Ordinance, 1943. That provision of law is completely in pari materia with section 23A. Two brothers, H. Bjordal and S. Bjordal, held 73.96 and 25.09 per cent. of the voting power. Five others held 04 per cent. of the voting power. The shares held by S. Bjordal were purchased for full value by him from his brother. There was no suggestion that he was a nominee of the respondent or that he was acting in concert with his brother. Both brothers were Directors of the Company. It was held by the Judicial Committee that shareholders in a company who are members of the 'public' do not cease to be so, because they become Directors. In the Uganda Ordinance also, like our Act, there was no guidance as to the meaning of the word 'public', as there was in the English statute considered in Tatem's case (2). It is significant that in Jubliee Mills Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax (3), Chagla, C. J., and S. T. Desai, J., speaking of the judgment under appeal and (1) [1955] A.C. 309. (2) [1941] 24 T.C. 57. (3) [1958] 34 I.T.R. 30, 41. taking into consideration the Privy Council case, observed: \"It may be that our view is erroneous; and it may be-and very probably it is-that the view taken by the Privy Council is the right one.\"In our judgment, the test is first to find out whether there is an individual or a group which controls the voting power as a block. If there be such a block, the shares held by it cannot be said to be \"unconditionally\" and \"beneficially\" held by members of the public. In the category of shares held by the public, only those shares can be counted which are unconditionally and beneficially held by the public, or, in other words, which are uncontrolled by the group, which controls the affairs. The group itself may be composed of Directors or their nominees or relations in different combinations, but none can be said to be.long to that group, be he a director or a relative unless he does not hold the shares unconditionally and beneficially for himself. It is only such a person, who can fall properly outside the word 'public'. Judged from this point of view, the judgment and orders of the High Court cannot be upheld. Directors cannot, by reason of being Directors, be said not to be members of the public. To that extent, the judgment is erroneous. There is a finding by the Tribunal in the supplementary statement of the case that the shares held by Bipinchandra, Harishchandra and Krishnakumar were under the control of their father, Maganlal Parbhudas. Their holding was 3,000 and with Maganlal's holding of 1,344 shares, makes up a total of 4,344 shares. Though the question as framed by the High Court appears to have been correctly answered in the negative, it does not dispose of the matter. The, question to be determined still is whether more than per cent. of the shares are not beneficially held by the public. We accordingly set aside the judgment and orders of the High Court, and direct the High Court to decide the question originally framed by it, viz.: \"Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case the provisions of section 23A of the Indian Income-tax Act, XI of 1922, are applicable to the petitioners?\" The High Court may call for a supplemental statement of the case from the Tribunal, if it finds it neces sary. The appeal is allowed. The respondents shall bear the costs of this appeal. The costs in the High Court shall abide the result. Appeal allowed."}, "annotations": [{"result": [{"value": {"start": 0, "end": 29, "text": "CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION:", "labels": ["NONE"]}}, {"value": {"start": 30, "end": 61, "text": "Civil Appeal number 30 of 1957.", "labels": ["NONE"]}}, {"value": {"start": 62, "end": 206, "text": "Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated September 1, 1955, of the Bombay High Court in Income-tax Reference number 37 of 1952.", "labels": ["NONE"]}}, {"value": {"start": 207, "end": 260, "text": "N.

Appeal from the Judgment and Order dated the 18th May, 1951, of the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta (Chakravartti and Das Gupta JJ.) in its Special Jurisdiction (Income-tax) in Income-tax Reference number 63 of 1950. N. C. Chatterjee (S. N. Mukherjee, with him) for the appellant. C. K. Daphtary, Solicitor-General for India (O. N. Joshi, with him) for the respondent. 1953. October 8. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI J.-This is an appeal from the judgment and order of the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta on a reference made by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal under Section 66(1) of the Indian Incometax Act (XI of 1922). The appellant is a banking company -carrying on business at, among other places, Calcutta and Allahabad. On the 15th March, 1946, the appellant executed a deed by which it purported to create a trust for the payment of pensions to the members of its staff. The deed declared that a pension fund had been constituted and established. It then recited that a sum of Rupees 2,00,000 had already been made over to three persons who were referred to as the \"present trustees\" and proceeded to state that the fund would consist in the first instance of the said sum of Rupees 2,00,000, and that there would be added to it such further contributions that the bank might make from time to time, though it would not be bound to make such contributions. In the course of the accounting year 1946-47, the bank made a further payment of Rupees 2,00,000 to this fund. In its assessment for the assessment year 1947-48 the appellant claimed deduction of that sum of Rupees 2,00,000 under section 10 (2) (xv) of the Act on the ground that it was an item of expenditure laid out or expended wholly and exclusively for the purposes of its business. The Income- tax Officer, the Appellate Assistant commissioner and the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal rejected this claim of the appellant and the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal at the instance of the appellant stated a case and referred for the consideration of the High Court the following question :- \"Whether in the facts and circumstances of this case, the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal was right in disallowing Rupees 2,00,000 as a deduction under section 10 (2) (xv) of the Indian Income-tax Act.\" The High Court answered the question in the affirmative and hence this appeal. Though several contentions were sought to be raised by the appellant as well as the Income-tax authorities before the High Court as arising from the question, the only contention which was canvassed before the High Court and was held to be determinative of the enquiry before it was whether the deed of trust dated198 the 15th March, 1946, was valid. On the construction of the several provisions of the deed of trust the High Court held :- \"I am of opinion that in view of these provisions of the trust deed coupled with the uncertainty as regards the beneficiaries and the absence of any obligation to grant any pension, no legal and effective trust was created, and the so-called trust must be held to be void,\" It further held that even if the ownership of the money had passed over to the trustees, still the further provision regarding the application of the money to the payment of pensions being entirely ineffective and void, the money cannot be said to have been expended for the purpose of the business, and that therefore was not an expenditure or an expenditure for the purposes of the business within the meaning of section 10(2)(xv) of the Act. This was also the only contention urged before us by Shri N. C. Chatterjee appearing on behalf of the appellant. Section 3 of the Indian Trusts Act (II of 1882) defines a trust as an obligation annexed to the ownership of property, and arising out of a confidence reposed in and accepted by the owner, or declared and accepted by him, for the benefit of another, or of another and the owner. The person for whose benefit the confidence is accepted is called the \"beneficiary\". Section 5 in so far as it is material for the purpose of this appeal says that no trust in relation to movable property is valid unless declared as aforesaid (i.e., by a non-testamentary instrument in writing signed by the author of the trust or the trustee and registered, or by the will of the author of the trust or of the trustee) or unless the ownership of the property is transferred to the trustee. Section 6 of the Act provides that subject to the provisions of section 5, a trust is created when the author of the trust indicates with reasonable certainty by any words or acts.................. (c) the beneficiary............ The validity or otherwise of the trust in question has got to be determined with reference to the above sections of the Indian Trusts Act, The deed of trust provided in clause 5 that the income of the fund if sufficient and if the income of the fund shall not be sufficient then the capital of the fund shall be applied in paying or if insufficient in contributing towards the payment of such pensions and in such manner as the bank or such officers thereof as shall be duly authorised by the bank in that behalf shall direct to be paid out of the fund. Clause 7 stated that the fund was established for the benefit of retiring employees on the European and Indian staff of the bank to whom pensions shall have been granted by the bank. Clause 8 provided that any officer on the European staff of the bank who had been in the service of the bank for at least twenty-five years and any officer or other employee on the Indian staff of the bank who had been in the service of the bank for at least thirty years might apply to the bank for a pension, and that in special circumstances the bank might grant pensions to employees who had not completed the respective periods of service above mentioned. Clause 9 provided for the withdrawal, modification or determination by the bank of any pension payable thereunder when in its opinion the conduct of the recipient or the circumstances of the case justified it in so doing and the trustees were bound forthwith to act upon any directions of the bank or of any officers thereof duly authorised by the bank in that behalf. Clause 11 invested the bank with discretion in fixing the amount of each pension and in making any modification therein but without prejudice to such discretion declared what were the pensions which it was contemplating would be payable to recipients qualified under the provisions of clause 8 of the deed. Clause 18 authorised the bank from time to time by instrument in writing under its common seal with the assent in writing of the trustees to alter all or any of the regulations contained in the deed for the time being relating to the fund and make new regulations to the exclusion of or in addition to all or any of the regulations for the time being relating to the fund and for the purposes of that clause all the provisions contained in the deed were deemed to be the regulations in relation to the fund.'On a consideration of the provisions of the deed of trust above set out it is clear that the bank or its officers duly authorised in that behalf were constituted the sole authorities to determine what pensions and in what manner the same should be paid out of the income of the fund. The fund was declared to have been established for the benefit of the retiring employees to whom pensions shall have been granted by the bank. Officers of the staff who were qualified under clause 8 were declared entitled to apply to the bank for a pension. But there was nothing in the terms of the deed which imposed any obligation on the bank or its officers duly authorised in that behalf to grant any pension to any such applicant. The pension if granted could also be withdrawn, modified or determined under the directions of the bank or any officer of the bank duly authorised in that behalf and such directions were binding on the trustees. The regulations in relation to the fund could also be altered and new regulations could be made to the exclusion of or in addition to all or any of the regulations contained in the deed of trust. It was open under the above provisions for the bank or its officers duly authorised in that behalf to grant no pension at all to any officer of the staff who made an application to them for a pension and also to withdraw, modify or determine any pension payable to such officer if in their opinion the conduct of the recipient or the circumstances of the case should justify them in so doing. The whole scheme of the deed invested the bank or its officers duly authorised in that behalf with the sole discretion of granting or of withdrawing, modifying or determining the pension and it was not at all obligatory on them at any time to grant any pension or to continue the same for any period whatever. The beneficiaries therefore could not be said to have been indicated with reasonable certainty. What is more it could also be validly urged that there being no obligation imposed upon the trustees no trust in fact was created, even though the moneys had been trans- ferred to the trustees. Shri N. C. Chatterjee however urged that the power conferred upon the bank or its officers duly authorisedin that behalf was a power in the nature of a trust, that there was a general intention in favour of a class and a particular intention in favour of individuals of a class to be selected by them and even though the particular intention failed from the selection not being made the court could carry into effect the general intention in favour of the class and that therefore the trust was valid. He relied in support of this contention on Brown v. Higgs(1) and Burrough v. Philcox(2). The position in law as it emerges from these authorities is thus summarised by Lewin on Trusts, Fifteenth fxEdition, page 324 :- \"Powers, in the sense in which the term is commonly used, may be distributed into mere powers, and powers in the nature of a trust. The former are powers in the proper sense of the word-that is not imperative, but purely discretionary; powers which the trustee cannot be compelled to execute, and which, on failure of the trustee, cannot be executed vicariously by the court. The latter, on the other hand, are not discretionary, but imperative, have all the nature and substance of a trust, and ought rather, as Lord Hardwicke observed, to be designated by the name of trusts. 'It is perfectly clear,' said Lord Eldon, 'that where there is a mere power, and that power is not executed, the court cannot execute it. It is equally clear, that wherever a trust is created, and the execution of the trust fails by the death of the trustee or by accident, this court will execute the trust. But there are not only a mere trust and a mere power, but there is also known to this court a power which the party to whom it is given is intrusted with and required to execute; and with regard to that species of power, the court considers it as partaking so much of the nature and qualities of a trust, that if the person who has the duty imposed upon him does not discharge it, the court will, to a certain extent, discharge the duty in his room and place'. Thus, if there is a power to appoint among certain objects but no gift to those objects and no gift over in default of appointment, the court implies a trust for or gift to (1) 8 ves. Junior 561 ; 32 E.R. 473. (2) 5 Mylne & Graig 72; 41 E.R. 299.those objects equally if the power be not exercised. But for the principle to operate there must be a clear indication that the settlor intended the power to be regarded in the nature of a trust.\" This position however does not avail the appellant. As already stated there is no clear indication in the deed of trust that the bank intended the power to be regarded in the nature of a trust, inasmuch as there was no obligation imposed on the bank or its officers duly authorised in that behalf to grant any pension to any applicant. There was no duty to grant any pension at all and the pension, if granted, could be withdrawn, modified or determined by the bank or its officers duly authorised in that behalf as therein mentioned. Under the circumstances it could not be said that there was a power in the nature of a trust which could be exercised by the court if the donee of the power for some reason or other did not exercise the same. It will be appropriate at this stage to consider whether any beneficiary claiming to be entitled to a pension under the terms of the deed could approach the court for the enforcement of any provision purporting to have been made for his benefit Even though he may be qualified under clause 8 to apply for the grant of a pension he could not certainly enforce that provision because there was no obligation imposed at all on the bank or its officers duly authorised in that behalf to grant any pension to him and in the absence of any such obligation imposed upon anybody it would be futile to urge that a valid trust was created in the manner contended on behalf of the appellant. In our opinion therefore the High Court was right in the conclusion to which it came that there was uncertainty as regards the beneficiaries and there was an absence of any obligation to grant any pension with the result that no legal and effective trust could be said to have been created and further that the provision of Rupees 2,00,000 in the accounting year 1946-47 was not an expenditure or an expenditure for the purposes of the business within the meaning of section 10 (2) (xv) of the Indian Income-tax Act.In view of the above we do not think it necessary to into the interesting questions which were sought to toe raised by the appellant, viz., what was the scope of the reference, and by the respondent, viz., whether the expenditure was a capital expenditure or revenue expenditure and if the latter whether the deduction could still not be allowed in view of the provisions of section 10 (4) (c) of the Act. The result therefore is that the appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs. Appeal dismissed. Agent for the appellant: P. K. Mukherjee. Agent for the respondent: G. H.

WITH S-L-.P-numbers 438/79 & 2113/80. T.S. Krishnamurty lyer, G. Narasimhalu, G.S. Narayana, K. Ram Kumar, Mrs. Anjani, Mrs. J. Ramachandran, T.T. Kunhi- kannan, S. Srinivasan and A.T.M. Sampath for the appearing parties. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KASLIWAL, J. In the above appeal and Special Leave Petitions question has been raised about the ambit and scope of Sec. 14(1) and 14(2) of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act'). Before adverting to the legal question, it would be proper to narrate in short the facts of each case. Civil Appeal number 630 of 1981 Thota Madhav Rao, the plaintiff filed a suit against Thota Manikyamma on the allegation that the plaintiffs father Yellamanda and the defendant's husband Late Venkata Subbayya were brothers. As the defendant and her husband had no issue they brought up the plaintiff as their foster son from the age of eight years and thereafter the plaintiff continued to live with them and was brought up treating him as their own son. Venkata Subbayya died on 14.1.1932 and before his death he executed a will bequeathing the suit properties in favour of his wife Shrimati Thota Manikyamma for her life with a vested remainder in favour of the plaintiff. Both the parties lived together with perfect understanding but after some time there was misunderstanding and the defendant assumed hostile attitude towards the plaintiff and began to claim the suit property as her absolute property.. The defendant also executed a registered will on 26.10.69 bequeathing the suit properties in favour of one Ramisetti Koteswar Rao. The plaintiff in these circumstances claimed absolute right in the suit properties after the lifetime of the defendant and challenged the right of the defendant to execute any will in respect of the suit properties. The defendant took the plea that her husband died issueless and intestate and did not execute any will at any time. Neither she nor her husband brought up the plaintiff as their foster son nor did they educate him. The defendant had brought up Ramisetti Koteswar Rao, who is her nephew, from his child- hood and performed his marriage. On account of love and affection for him and his children, the defendant executed a registered will on 26.10.69 bequeathing all her properties in his favour.. The Trial Court held the will dated 14.1.1932 proved and decreed the plaintiffs suit. The First Appellate Court upheld the Judgment and decree of the Trial Court. The defendant preferred a second' appeal in the High Court. During the pendency of the Second Appeal in theHigh Court the plaintiff died and his legal representatives were brought on record. The High Court by Judgment dated 24.8.1979 allowed the second appeal and dismissed the suit with costs throughout. The legal representatives of the plaintiff have come to this Court by grant of special leave. The question involved is whether the life interest in the property acquired by Thota Manikyamma under the will execut- ed by her husband and continued to be in her possession became her absolute property under Sec. 14(1) of the Act. Special Leave Petition (C) number 438 of 1979 One Meenammal is the wife of Ovi Reddiar. Married life between Ovi Reddiar and his wife. was not happy and cordial. Ovi Reddiar executed a registered will exhibit A-4 dated 21.3.1921 bequeathing all his properties including the suit properties in favour of .his mother and sister for their lifetime and thereafter in favour of Ramalinga Reddiar and Dhanush Koti Reddiar, the two sons of his sister and their issues. In the said will reference was made regarding the' conduct of Meenammal in deserting him and in any event if she changed her mind and agreed to live under the protection of the legatees she was allowed to enjoy the income from item I of the suit properties and that she should construct a house in item referred to in the will and to live there during her lifetime and after her death the said Item and the house site .with the house shall go to the above men- tioned Ramalinga Reddiar and Dhanush Koti Reddiar. Ovi Reddiar died in 1922 and thereafter the legatees under the will entered into possession of all the proper- ties. Shrimati Meenammal put obstruction to the legatees in getting possession. There was some criminal litigation between Shrimati Meenam- mal and the legatees under Sec. 145 Criminal P.C. which resulted in favour of the legatees (exhibit A-1). Shrimati Meenammal then filed a suit in 1923 praying for a declaration that the will made by her husband was not valid and as such be cancelled and for possession and mesne profits and in the alternative she claimed for maintenance both past and future. In the said suit the parties entered into a compromise and a com- promise decree was passed on 5.3.1924, vide (exhibit A-1). Under the terms of said compromise the execution of the will was accepted and the same was made subject to the terms of the compromise decree. Under the compromise .decree it was agreed that Shrimati Meenammal would enjoy items 1 & 2 of the properties mentioned in the will and also 50 cents of land during her lifetime. She would also have an enjoyment of thehouse site during her lifetime without any right of aliena- tion.' Dhanush Koti died unmarried in 1930 but during his lifetime he sold his interest in. the properties in favour of Ramalinga Reddiar. Ramalinga Reddiar died in 1962. On his death the petitioners before this Court being the sons and daughters of Ramalinga Reddiar Claimed to have become enti- tled for all the properties of Ramalinga Reddiar including the rights in the suit property. smt. Meenammal during her lifetime executed a settlement deed in favour of the re- spendents before this Court giving absolute rights in the suit properties. The petitioners before this Court filed a suit against Shrimati Meenammal and the respondents for declara- tion that the settlement deed (exhibit A-10) executed by Shrimati Meenammal will not enure beyond the lifetime of Shrimati Meenammal. Shrimati Meenammal contested the suit and took the plea that the limited interest given to her under the com- promise decree had become enlarged into absolute right by virtue of Section 14(1) of the Act. The Trial Court decreed the suit and it was. affirmed in first appeal. Shrimati Meenam- mal having died., the respondents in this Court preferred a second appeal in the High Court of Judicature at Madras. The High Court allowed the Second Appeal and dismissed the suit filed by the petitioners. The petitioners in these circum- stances have filed the S .L.P. under Article 136 of the Constitution of India, S.L.P. (C) number 2113 of 1980 The suit properties as well as some other properties originally belonged to one Ramalinga Udayar. He had two wives, namely, Alamolu and Saraswati. the first wife Alamolu was living away from her husband. Ramalinga did not have any issue from both the wives. Ramalinga being attached with one Siva Subramania the petitioner before us executed a will on 2.7. 1945 ,bequeathing his properties in favour of his second wife Saraswati for her lifetime and thereafter, absolutely in favour of Siva Subramania. A provision was also made for the payment of Rupees 68 and a direction to make available 18 kalams of paddy in favour of Alamolu for her lifetime. In order to ensure the payment of the maintenance and delivery of paddy a charge was also created over the properties to go ultimately in favour of Siva Subramania Udayar. As Siva Subramania Udayar was a minor at that time the second wife Shrimati Saraswati was appointed as his guard- ian. Ramalinga died on 8.7.45 and subsequently his first wife Alamolu was awarded 50 kalams of paddy and a sum Of Rupees 250 in cash perannum'by way of maintenance. On appeal the High Court modified the decree of the Trial Court and en- hanced the maintenance to Rupees 480 per annumand directed Siva Subramania the legatee under the will to give one building for the residence of Alamolu. Thereafter in 195 1 Alamolu sought the recovery of possession of one of the buildings and the Executing Court alltted to her the eastern house backyard and the shops. The second wife saras- wati preferred an appeal to the High Court against the above order of the executing court. A compromise was entered into between the parties in the High Court. According to the terms of compromise Alamolu was permitted to occupy the eastern house together with the two shops but the backyard portion was not given. Alamoler however remained in posses- sion of that portion as well, where some coconut trees were standing. Lateron Saraswati was removed from the guardian- ship of Siva Subramania Udayar, and natural father was appointed as his guardian. Alamolu died on 2.2.1966. The respondents before us are brother's grandsons of Alamolu. Alamolu settled the suit properties in favour of one Chan- drashekhar Udayar claiming title to the same in pursuance to a compromise in A.A.O. 567 of 1950. Ramayya Mudaliar another respondent before us initially took on lease the properties from Chandrashekhar and lateron purchased the eastern half of the building and backyard portion. Siva Subramania Udayar challenged these transactions on the grounds that Alamolu was given a right of residence only in the building and the same lasted till her lifetime and such right could never be enlarged into an absolute right. The settlement deed made by her in favour of Chandrashekhar Udayar and the sale made by Chandrashekhar in favour of Ramaiah were invalid and no title could be conveyed by Alamolu in their favour. Siva Subramania Udayar as such filed a suit for recovery of possession of the suit properties with mesne profits. The Trial Court held that Alamolu was not the absolute owner of the suit properties as contemplated under Section 14(2) of the Act. The suit as such was decreed in favour of the plaintiff Siva Subramania Udayar. Learned Single Judge of the High Court dismissed the appeal. On a Letters Patent Appeal the Division Bench of the High Court allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit. The plaintiff Siva Subramania Udayar has filed the S.L.P. under Article 136 of the Consti- tution of India. The controversy raised in these cases is almost settled by a number of decisions of this Court. However, Learned counsel for the appellant in the appeal as well as Learned counsel for the petitioners in the Special Leave Petitions have raised an argument, placing reliance on Mst. Karrni v. Amru and ORS , [1972] 4 SCC 86 that the life estate given to a widow under the will of her husband cannot become an absolute estate under the provisions of the Hindu succession Act, as such we consider it proper to deal with this case in the light of other cases decided by this Court. Section 14 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 reads as under: 14\"(1) Any property possessed by a female Hindu, whether acquired before or after the commencement of this Act, shall be held by her as full owner thereof and not as a limited owner. Explanation--In this sub-section, \"property\" includes both movable and immovable property acquired by a female Hindu by inheritance or devise, or at a partition, or in lieu of maintenance or arrears of maintenance, or by gift from any person. Whether a relative or not, before. at or after her marriage, or by her own skill or exertion, or by purchase or by prescription, or in any other manner what- soever, and also any such property held by her as stridhana immediately before the commence- ment of this Act. (2) Nothing contained in sub-section (1) shall apply to any property acquired by way of gift or under a will or any other instrument or under a decree or order or a civil court or under an award where the terms of the gift, will or other instrument or the decree. order or award prescribe a restricted estate in such property\". The contention raised is that if a female Hindu acquires any property under a will which gives her a restricted estate in such property then provisions of sub-section (2) will over- ride, the provisions of subsection (1) of Section 14 of the Act which makes a female Hindu as full owner. In Badri Prashad v. Shrimati Kanso Devi, [1970] 2 SCR 95 a Bench of three Judges considered the question in detail. In the above case a Hindu having self acquired properties, died in 1947 leaving five sons and a widow. On a dispute between the parties an Arbitrator was appointed in 1950. The Arbitrator gave an award and a decree was passed in terms of award. Under the award the widow was given widow's estate. It was held that the widow inherited the property under Section 3 (1) of the Hindu Women's Right to Property Act, 1937 and was in possession of it within the meaning of the word possession in Scetion 14(1) of the Act and when by an award her share was separetaed by metes and bounds, she also acquired the property withinthe meaning of that section. It was held that she had become full owner of the property in her possession under Section 14(i) on the coming into force of the Hindu Succession Act, even though previously she was a limited owner. It was clearly held in the above case that Section 14(2) of the Act is in the nature of a proviso or an excep- tion to Section 14(1) and comes into operation only if acquisitiOn in any of the methods indicated therein is made for the first time without there being any pre-existing right in the female Hindu to the property. The Bench con- sisted of Hon. J.C. Shah, V. Ramaswamy and A.N. Grover, JJ. The case of Mst. Karmi v. Amru and Others, (supra) on which reliance has now been placed by Learned Counsel for the appellant and petitioners was also decided by a Bench of three Judges Hon. J.C. Shah, K.S. Hegde and A.N. Grover, JJ. It may be noted that two Hon'ble Judges, namely, J.C. Shah and A.N. Grover were common to both the cases. In Mst. Karmi v. Arnru and Others, one Jaimal died in 1938 leaving his wife Nihali. His son Ditta pre-deceased him. Appellant in the above case was the daughter of Ditta and the respondents were collaterals of Jaimal. Jaimal first executed a will dated 18.12.1935 and by a subsequent will dated 13.11.1937 revoked the first will. By the second will a life estate was given to Nihali and thereafter the property was made to devolve on Bhagtu and Armu collaterals. On the death of Jaimal in 1938, properties were mutuated in the name of Nihali Nihali died in 1960/61. The appellant Mst. Karmi claimed right on the basis of a will dated 25.4.1958 execut- ed by Nihali in her favour. It was held that the life estate given to a widow under the will of her husband cannot become an absolute estate under the provisions of the Hindu Succes- sion Act. Thereafter, the appellant cannot claim the to the properties on the basis of the will executed by the widow Nihali in her favour. It is a short Judgment without advert- ing to any provisions of Sections 14(1) or 14(2) of the Act. The Judgment neither makes any mention of any argument raised in this regard nor there is any mention of the earli- er decision in Badri Pershad v. Shrimati Kanso Devi, (supra). The decision in Mst. Karmi & ANR cannot be considered as an authority on the ambit and scope of Sections 14(1) and (2) of the Act. The controversy regarding sub-Section (1) and (2) of Section 14 of the Act again came up for consideration in V. Tulsamrna & ORS v. V. Sesha Reddy (dead) by Lrs., [1977] 3 SCR 261. This case was also, decided by a Bench of three Judges. In this case the controversy now raised before us was considered in detail. All the earlier cases wereconsidered including Badri Prasad v. Shrimati Kanso Devi, (supra) and the ratio of this case was followed and approved in V. Tulsamma's case. Hon'ble Bhagwati, J. who wrote the leading judgment dealt with the question in detail and after applying the mind to the controversy decided the same in a well considered manner. V. Tulsamma's case again was dis- cussed in extenso and followed in Bai Vajia (dead) by L. Rupees v. Thakorbhai Chelabhai & On., [1979] 3 SCR 291, by a Bench of three Judges. The same view has been consistently adopted in long series of cases of this Court and to mention a few of them are Jagannathan Pillai v. Kunjithapadam Pillai & ORS , [ 1987] 2 SCC 572; Gopal Singh & ANR v. Dill Ram (dead) by L.Rupees & ORS , [1988] 1 SCC 47; Gulwant Kaur and Others v. Mohinder Singh and Others, [ 1987] 3 SCC 674 and Jaswant Kaur v. Major Harpal Singh, [ 1989] 3 SCC 572. A mention of all the above cases shows that this Court in a long series 'of cases has taken a consistent view that Sec. 14(2) of the Act is in the nature of a proviso or an exception to Sec. 14 and comes into operation only if acqui- sition in any of the methods indicated therein is made for the first time without there being any pre-existing right in the female Hindu to the property. If the case falls under the provisions of Sec. 14(1)of the ACt then the female Hindu shall be held to be full owner of the property and sub- section (2) of Section 14 will only apply where the property is acquired without there being and pre-exisitingisting right of the female Hindu in such property. Thus we a firm and reiterate that sub-section (2) of Sec. 14 will be con- strued more in the nature of a proviso or an exception to sub-section (1) of Sec. 1 of the Act. This view lends support to the object of the section which was to remove the disability on women imposed by law and to achive a social purpose by bringing about change in the social and economic position of women in Hindu society. In the result we find no force in all the above cases and are dismissed with cost. K. RAMASWAMY, J. 'I have had the advantage to read the draft judgment of my learned brother. I fully agree with the resoning and conclusions. The repeated attempts to reopen the ratio in Tulasamma's case, in particular, from its proponent i.e. Sri Krishna Murthy lyar made me to tread the route through which I reached the same result thus:Sir Main Henry in his \"Earlier History of Institutions\" at p. 339 stated that, \"the degree in which personal immuni- ty and proprietorycapacity of women are recognised in a particular state or community is a test of the degree of the advance of its civilisation. It is, therefore, clear that the esteem in which woman is held, the status occupied by her in society and the treatment meted out to her are regarded as index to the degree of civilisation and culture attained in a coun- try. Manu in his Smriti, Chapter III Verses 55 to 57 stated that where women are honoured and adorned there Gods are pleased, but where women are not honoured no sacred fire yields rewards. What is the status held by women in the Hindu society is a matter of history reflected from Vedic culture, Smrities, the Shastric law, the statutory privision and ultimately converged and recognised in the supreme law of the land, i.e. egalitarian socialist Indian Constitution. E .S. Shivaswamy lyer in his \"Revolution of Hindu Women, \" 1935 ,Edn. p. 64 stated that the ideals of the society as to womanhood includes not merely the relations of husband and wife or mother and children or the other intimate rela- tionship of family life, but also the notions we find about her capacity, her character, her claim to equality, inde- pendence and freedom for developing, her rights to personal ownership and control of property, to the choice of her vocation and other rights as well as duties as member of the society. Status and rights of Hindu woman fluctuated and swung like a pendulum with ups and downs from period to period starting from 4000 B.C. uptodate. However esteem for women remained constantly high in the society. In Vedic society woman enjoyed equal status economical- ly, socially and culturally with men, vide p. 335,339 and 409 of The Position of Woman in Hindu Civilization, 1955 Edn. by Altakar. He stated that initiation to education upanayanam was performed in Vedic period to the girls as well as boys. Women studied the Vedas, even composed Vedic rhymes. They participated in public life freely. Vishvavara, Apala, Lopamudra and Shashayasi are only few examples in the initial Vedic period. Thereafter Ghosha, Maitrai and Gargi occupied price of place for equality in intellectual excel- lence and equal status with men. Selfishness and male chau- vanism made woman to gradually degrade and were given no voice even in the settlement of their marriages or so on. She was denied participation in public affairs. Though Yajnavalkya was a proponent to her economic status but ultimately Manu Smriti took firm hold and in Chapter IX Verse 18, Manu stated that woman had no right to study the Vedas. Thereby, denied the right to education, fundamental human right to acquire knowledge and cultural and intellec- tual excellence. In Chapter IX Verse 149, he stated that woman must not seek. separation from father, husband orson and bondaged her for ever. In Chapter IX Verse 45, the husband was declared to be one with the wife that the wife can seek no divorce but allowed immunity to a male to dis- card an unwanted wife. All through the ages till Hindu Marriage Act was made a male was allowed polyandry. In Chapter IX Verse 4 16, he stated that a wife, a son and a slave are declared to have no property and if they happened to acquire it would belong to male under whom she is in protection. Thus she was denuded or her right to property or incentive to decent and independent living and made her a dependent only to rare children and bear the burdens. When she becomes a widow, she was declared to have only mainte- nance and if in possession of her husband's property or coparcenery, to be a widow's estate with reversionery right to the heirs of last male holder. Fidality was a condition precedent to receive maintenance. In Chapter IX Verse 299, he prescribed corporeal punishment to a wife who commits faults, should be beaten with a rope or a split bamboo. If she was murdered it was declared to be an Upapattaka that is a minor offence vide Chapter XI Verse 67. I did not adhere to literal translation but attempted to portray their sweep and deep incursion on social order. Thus laid firm founda- tion to deny a Hindu female of equality of status. opportu- nity and dignity of person with no independent right to property and made her a subservient, socially, educationally and culturally. Widows were murdered by inhuman Sati and now by bride burnings. Gautam Budha gave her equality of status and opportuni- ty. Efforts of social reformers like Raja Ram Mohan Rai, Kandukuri Veeresalingam and a host of other enlightened made the British Rulers gradually to make statute law, given her right to separate residence and maintenance and a right over property of her husband or joint family for maintenance and a charge by a decree of court. Mahatma Gandhiji, the father of the nation, in Young India on October 17, 1929 had writ- ten thus: \"I am uncompromising in the matters of women's rights. In my opinion she should live under no legal disa- bility, no suffering by men, we should treat the daughters and sons on the footing of perfect equality\". Shri Ravindra Nath Tagore, the Noble laureate in his speech in 1913 re- printed in \"To the Women\" at page 18 stated \"that women is the champion of man, gifted with equal mental capacity. She has a right to participate in any minutest activity of men and she has equal right of freedom and liberty with him\". The Constitution of India accords socio-economic and political justice, equality of status and of opportunity assuring the dignity of person with stated freedoms. Article 14 guarantees equality. In otherwords frowns upon discrimination on any ground. Article 15(1) abolishes discrimination and removed disability, liability or restriction on grounds of sex and ensures equality of status. Arti- cle 29(2) gives equal right to education. In the earliest decision this Court upheld it in State of Madras v. Srimathi Champakam Dorairajan, [1951] SCR 525. Article 16(1) accords equality of opportunity in public service for an appointment or employment to an office or post under the State and prohibits gender discrimination. Marriage as a disability for appointment to Indian foreign service was declared unconstitutional in C.S. Muthammav. Union of India & ORS , [1980] 1 SCR 668. Pregnancy as a disqualification to contin- ue in public employment was held to be an affront to equali- ty of status, dignity of person and equal opportunity vio- lating Articles 14 and 16(1) in Air India v. Nergesh Meerza & ORS , [1982] 1 SCR 438. It abhors or is loathe to civili- ty. These are few classic illustrations. Article 15(3) treats women as a class, mitigates the rigour of absolute equality enshrined in article 14 and its species article 15(1) & 16(1) and enjoins the State to make any special provision to remedy past injustice and to advance their status, soeio- econmic and political. Article 21 assures protection of life which includes right to livelihood. Article 38(1) obligates the State to promote the welfare of the people by securing social order in which socio-economic and political justice shall inform all the institutions of the national life. Subarticle (2) thereof further enjoins the State to minimise the inequalities in income and to eliminate inequalities ,in status by providing facilities and opportunities to all individuals. Women should have adequate means of livelihood on par with men, article 39(a); should have equal pay for equal work, article 39(d); health and strength of working women are not abused. Economic necessity is not a sanctuary to abuse her person or she should not be forced to an unsuited avoca- tion, article 39(e); State shall provide just and human condi- tions of work and maternity relief [article 42]. Article 46 mandates the State to promote with special care the economic and educational conditions of the weaker sections of the people. It also enjoins to protect them from social injus- tice and all forms of exploitation. To enliven and alongate this constitutional goal to render socioeconomic justice, to relieve Hindu female from degradation, disabilities, disadvantages and restrictions under which Hindu females have been languishing over cen- turies and to integrate them in national and international life, Bharat Ratna Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the first Law Minister and rounding father of the Constitution drafted Hindu Code Bill. The Hindu, Marriage Act, Adoption and Maintenance Act; Minority and Guardianship Act and Succes- sion Act 1956, for short'the Act' became a part of this package. They ensue equal status and socio-economic justice to Hindu female. In a socialist democracy governed by rule of law, law as a social engineering should bring about transformation in-the social structure. Whenever a socio-economic legislation or the rule or instruments touching the implementation of welfare meas- ures arise for consideration, this historical evidence furnishes as the foundation and all other relevant material would be kept at the back of the court's mind. Section 14(1) of the Act declares that any property, movable or immovable, possessed by a female Hindu shall be held by her as full owner thereof and not as a limited owner irrespective of the time when the acquisition was made, i.e., whether it was before or after the Act. Undoubtedly as contended by Sri Krishna Murty Iyer, a Hindu male has free- dom of testamentary disposition of his property or by con- tract and section 14(1) stand an impediment in his way. Freedom of contract would yield place to public policy envisaged above. Its effect must be tested on the envil of socio- economic justice, equality of status and to oversee whether it would subserve the constitutional animation or frus- trates. article 15(3) relieves from the rigour of article 15(1) and charges the State to make special provision to accord to-women socioeconomic equality. The court would, therefore, endeavour to find whether terms of the disposition or clauses in the instruments, will etc.. enumerated in section 14 would permeate the aforestated constitutional conscience to relieve the Hindu female from the Shastric bondage of limit- ed estate. Both sub-sections (1) and (2) of section 14 attract the conferment of restricted estate had by a Hindu female under an instrument, i.e. gift, will, decree or order of a Civil Court or an award. Section 14 and the impugned docu- ment must be read harmoniously as an integral scheme. The disability attached to Hindu female by Shastric Law was removed by statutory provisons in Hindu Succession Act. Section 14(1) thereof was thought to be a tool to remove disabilities or restrictions imposed by Customary or Shas- tric Law on Hindu women. section 14(1) declares in unequivocal terms that the property whether movable or immovable held by a Hindu female acquired either before or after the Act shall be her absolute property, abolishing the limited estate known to Shastric law. Hindu women as a class are declared as class I heirs entitling to intestate succession to a 0Hindu Male. This Court in Pratap Singh v. Union of India, [1985] Suppl. 2 SCR 773 held that section 14 of the Act does not discriminate on grounds of sex and is intra vires of Art. 15(3). The preferential treatment accorded, thereby, was held to be not .violative of articles 14 and 15(1). Sub-section (2) of section 14 of the Act attempts to denude the object of sub-section (1) andemasculates its efficacy. It should, therefore, be' read as an exception or a proviso to sub-section (1) of section 14. The interpretation of the' proviso or an exception should not be to allow. to 'eat away the vital veins of full ownership accorded by sub-section (1) of section 14 when this Court upheld the validity of section 14(1) on the envil of Art; 15(3)what should be the message thus intended to convey? It would mean that the court would endeavour to give full effect tO legis- lative and constitutional vision of socio-economic equality to female 'citizen by granting full ownership of property to a Hindu female. As a fact article 15(3) as a fore runner to common code does animate 'to 'make law to accord socio- economic equality to every female citizen of India, irre- spective of religion, race cast or region. In Seth Badri Preasad v. Shrimati Kanso Devi, [.1969] 2 SCC :586 in an injunction suit against the respondent, the appellant ,contended that the respondent was given limited estate in a decree passed in an award and that, therefore, section 14(2) applies. Negating that contention, this court held that sub-sec. (2) of section 14 is more in the nature of a provi- so or an exception to sub-sec. (1). It can come into opera- tion only if the acquisition is in any of the methods indi- cated in sUb sec. (2).without there being any pre-existing right in the female Hindu who is in possession of the property. I Section 14(1) removes the disability of the woman. 'It was accordingly held that though she came into possession by virtue of decree passed in an award as limited estate, she acquired the absolute ownership under sub-sec. (1) of section 14. Section 14 was subject of critical consideration in V. Tulasamma v.V. Sesha Reddy (dead) by L.Rupees , [1977] 3 SCR 261 and its ratio has become a Tulsidalam to Hindu. women as locus classicus giving forward thrust. to constitutional goal according full ownership in the property, movable or immovable,. held by: her as full owner thereof; redeemed her from the shackles of women estate known to Shastric law. Fazal Ali, J. undertook extensive survey into sources of Hindu Law and found'that Hindu widow's right to maintenance is a personal obligation of the husband and he has a duty to-maintain her even if he has no property. Her right to maintenance would become an-eqUitable charge on her hus- band's property though no charge was created by a decree of civil court as \"jus ad rem\", i.e. right over property though not right to property \"jus in rem\" and any person who suc- ceeds to the property carries with it a legal obligation to maintain the wife from her husband's estate. Only .bona fide purchaser for value without notice alone was relieved of this Obligation; The right to maintenance is a pre-existing right preceding Hindu Women's Right to Property andSeparate Residence Act, 1946. Section 14(1) recognises her preexisting right. Any property acquired by Hindu female by inheritence or device or at a partition or. in lieu of maintenance or arrears of maintenance or by gift from any person Whether relative or not, before, at or after her marriage, or by her own skill or,exertion, or by purchase or by prescription or in any other manner whatsoever, and also suCh property held by her as stridhana immediately before the commencement of this Act, movable or immovable property shall be held by her as full owner thereto and not as a limited owner. Subsection (2) thereto shall be construed as an exception or a proviso which cannot be read to ,emascu- late the purpose enunciated under sub-section (1). There- fore, the property held by her or property given to her at a partition, or under a compromise decree, gift, or in lieu of maintenance .and held by her,on the date when the ACt.came into force, namely, June 17, 1956 shall be her absolute property as full owner. Bhagwati J. (as he then was) speak- ing for himself and Gupta, J. while pointing out the faulty drafting of section 14, held that section 14(1) seeks to do away with the traditional limitation of her power of disposition which were regarded under the Hindu law as inherent all her es- tate. The words \"possessed of\" means as the state of owning or having in one's hand or power which need not be actual or physical possession or personal occupation of the property by the Hindu female. It may be actual or constructive or in any form recognised by law. Sub-section (1) of section 14cannot be interpreted in a manner which would deprive the Hindu woman of the protection sought to be given to her by sub- section (1). The social purpose of the law-would be frus- trated and reformist zeal underlying the statutory provison would be chilled. It was not the intention of the legisla- ture in enacting sub-section (2) which must be construed as an exception or a proviso to sub-section (1). No provision should be construed in isolation and be read in the context so as to . make a consistent enactment of the whole statute. Sub-section (2) must be read in the context of sub-section (1) of section 14 and if so read sub-section (2) must be confined to cases where the Hindu female acquires the property for the first time as a grant without any preexisting right to the property under a will or by way of gift. or in-any other instruments or a decree or order of the civil court or an award, the terms of-which prescribe a restricted estate in the property. Subsection (2) must be read as an exception or proviso to sub-section (1) so as to leave aS large a scope for operation as possible to sub-section (1) of section 14. It was, therefore, held that the property given to Tulasmma in a compromise decree in lieu of her maintenance with re- stricted estate known as widow's estate in Hindu law was enlarged and she became an absolute owner under the Act. She had the right toalienate the property in favour of the others. An attempt to reopen the ratio was thwarted by this Court in Bai Vajia (dead) by L.Rs, v. Thakorbhai Chelabhai &.ORS , [1979] 3 SCR 291 while reaffirming the ratio of Tulasamma's case as correct law, this Court further held that limited ownership is sine quo non for the applicability of sub-section (1) of section 14 of the Act. When a widow holds a property for her enjoyment, as long as she lives, no body is entitled to deprive her or to deal with the property in any manner, to her detriment. The property is for the time being beneficially Vested in her and she has the occupation, control and usufruct of it to the exclusion of all others. SUch relationship to property falls squarely within the meaning of expression of \"limited owner\" as under S. 14(1) of the Act. In that context approved the dictum of Bhagwati, J. that section 14(1) aimed to achieve a social purpose. to bring about change \"in the social and economic position of women 'in Hindu Society\", It was a step to accord equality of sex, elevating women from subservient position in the economic field to higher pedestal with full ownership untrammelled by artificial limitation of Women's estate created by male dominence to subjugate her.

Appeal from the judgment and order dated June 20, 1962 of the Mysore High Court in Income-tax Reference Case number 15 of 1961. K. Srinivasan and R. Gopalakrishnan, for the appellant. A. V. Viswanatha Sastri, R. Ganapathy lyer and R. N. Sach- they, for the respondent. S. T. Desai, R. P. Kapur for I. N. Shroff, for the intervener. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Shah, J. One Buddappa, his wife, his two unmarried daughters and his adopted son Buddanna were members of a Hindu undivided family. Buddappa died on July 9, 1952. In respect of the business dealings of the family, Buddappa was assessed during his life-time in the status of a manager of the Hindu undivided family. For the assessment year 1951-52 the Additional Income-tax Officer, Raichur assessed Buddanna in respect of the income of the previous year which ended on November 8, 1950 as a Hindu undivided family under the title \"Sri Gowli Buddappa (deceased) represented by his legal successor Sri Gowli Buddanna, On Mills Owner, Raichur\". The order of assessment was confirmed in appeal by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, subject to the variation that the assessment was made under the title \"Buddanna a Hindu undivided family\". The Income-tax Appellate Tribunal confirmed the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. The Tribunal then referred the following questions of law to, High Court of Mysore for opinion under section 66(1) of the Indian Income-tax Act : (i) Whether the sole male surviving coparcener of the Hindu joint family, his widowed mother and sisters constitute a Hindu undivided family within the meaning of the Income-tax Act ? (ii) Whether the assessment of the income in the hands' of the Hindu undivided family was correct ? (iii) Whether the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was entitled to correct the status ?\" The High Court recorded answers in the affirmative on all the questions. With certificate granted by the High Court under section 66-A of the Indian Income-tax Act, Buddanna has appealed to this Court. Before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner it was contended by Buddanna that he could in law have only been assessed as an individual and that the Income-tax Officer was precluded by virtue of the proviso to section 26(2) to pass the order for assessment for the year 1951-52 against him. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the Appellate Tribunal rejected that contention. Buddappa was a resident of and carried on business at Rai- chur which before January 26, 1950, formed part of the territory of H.E.H. the Nizam. The joint family of Buddappa and Buddanna was governed by the Mitakshara School of Hindu law, and there was at the material time no legislation in force in the territory by which on the death of a male member in a joint Hindu family interest in the family estate devolved upon his widow. Such a widow had therefore only a right to receive maintenance from the estate. Counsel for the appellant urged that the expression \"Hindu undivided family\" used in section 3 of the Income-tax Act a Hindu coparcenary and when on the death of one out of two coparceners the entire property devolves upon a single coparcener, assessment cannot be made on the surviving coparcener in the status of a Hindu undivided family. Alternatively, it was contended that even if the entity Hindu undivided family in the charging section of the Income-tax Act is intended to mean a Hindu joint family, there must be at least two male members in the family, and where there are not two such members the sole surviving male member of the family, even if there be widows entitled to maintenance out of the estate, may be assessed in the status of an individual, and not of a Hindu undivided family, unless , . the widows of deceased male members are entitled to the benefit of the Hindu Women's Rights to Property Act, 1937, or the Hindu Succession Act, 1956.The first contention is plainly unsustainable. Under section 3 of the Income-tax Act not a Hindu coparcenary but a Hindu undivided family is one of the assessable entities. A Hindu joint family consists of all persons lineally descended from a common ancestor, and includes their wives and un-married daughters. A Hindu coparcenary is a much narrower body than the joint family: it includes only those persons who acquire by birth an interest in the joint or coparcenary property, these being the sons, grandsons and great-grandsons of the holder of the joint property for the time being. Therefore there may be a joint Hindu family consisting of a single male member and widows of deceased coparceners. In Kalyanji Vithaldas & Others v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Bengal(1), delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, Sir George Rankin observed: \"The phrase \"Hindu undivided family\" is used in the statute with reference not to one school only of Hindu law but to all schools; and their Lordships think it a mistake in method to begin by pasting over the wider phrase of the Act the words \"Hindu coparcenary\", all the more that it is not possible to say on the face of the Act that no female can be a member.\" The plea that there must be at least two male members to form a Hindu undivided family as a taxable entity also has no force. The expression \"Hindu undivided family\" in the Income-tax Act is used in the sense in which a Hindu joint family is understood under the personal law of Hindus. Under the Hindu system of law a joint family may consist of a single male member and widows of deceased male members, and apparently the Income-tax Act does not indicate that a Hindu undivided family as an assessable entity must consist of at least two male members. Counsel for the appellant said that there are certain intrinsic indications in the annual Finance Acts which support the contention that the income received or arising from property in the hands of a sole surviving male member in a joint Hindu family, even if there be females having a right to maintenance out of that property, is taxable as income of an individual, and not of the family. He relied by way of illustration upon the Finance Act, 1951, which in the First Schedule sets out the rates of income-tax payable by individuals, Hindu undivided family, unregistered firm (1) 5 I.T.R. 90=L.R. 64 I.A. 28.and other association of persons. The relevant part of the First Schedule prescribing rates of tax is as follows \"Provided that- (i) no income-tax shall be payable on a total income which, before deduction of the allowance, if any, for earned income, does not exceed the limit specified below; The limit referred to in the above proviso shall be- (i) Rupees 7,200 in the case of every Hindu undivided family which satisfies as at the end of the previous year either of the following conditions, namely : (a) that it has at least two members entitled to claim partition who are not less than 18 years of age; or (b) that it has at least two members entitled to claim partition neither of whom is a lineal descendant of the other and both of whom are not lineally descended from any other living member of the family; and (ii) Rupees 3,600 in every other case.\" But the. Schedule sets out the limits of exempted income: it does not state or imply that a Hindu undivided family must consist of at least two members entitled to claim partition. The text of the clause furnishes a clear indication to the contrary. Reliance was also placed upon the form of \"Return\" prescrib- ed under the Rules, which by section 59 of the Income-tax Act, 1922 have effect as if enacted in the Act. Part IIIA of the Form prescribes certain particulars to be incorporated in the case of a Hindu undivided family, viz. names of members of the family at the end of the previous year who were entitled to claim partition, relationship, age at the end of the previous year and remarks, but thereby it is not intended that a Hindu undivided family as an assessable entity does not exist so long as there are not at least two or more members entitled to claim partition. The informa- tion is required to be given in Part MA of the Form merely to enable the Income-tax Officer to consider which of the two parts of the proviso in the First Schedule to the relevant Finance Act prescribing the limit of exemption in respect of the Hindu undivided family applies.Sub-section (1) of section 25-A on which reliance was placed also does not imply that a Hindu undivided family must consist of more male members than one. The subsection only prescribes the procedure whereby the members of a family which has kither to been assessed in the status of a Hindu undivided family may obtain an order that they may, because of partition of the joint status, be assessed as separated members. 'Me clause is purely procedural: it does not enact either expressly or by implication that a Hindu undivided family assessed as a unit must consist of at least two male, members who are capable of demanding a partition. Counsel for the appellant placed strong reliance upon certain observations of the Judicial Committe in the judgment in Kalyanji Yithaldas's case(1) in which they disapproved of the view expressed by the Bombay High Court in Commissioner of Income-tax Bombay v. Gomedalli Lakshminarayan (2 ). In the case decided by the Bombay High Court a joint family consisted of a father and a son and their respective wives. The father died, and in the year of assessment the joint family consisted of the son, his mother and his wife. In dealing with the question referred by the Commissioner of Income-tax whether the income received by the son should be regarded as his individual income or as the income of a Hindu undivided family for the purpose of assessment to super-tax under the Indian Income-tax Act, the Bombay High Court held that the expression \"Hindu undivided family\" as used in the Income-tax Act includes families consisting of a sole surviving male member and female members entitled to maintenance, and the income of the assessee should therefore be treated as the income of a Hindu undivided family. In Kalyanji Vithaldas's case(1) which dealt with a group of appeals from the judgment of the Calcutta High Court in In re Moolji Sicka & Others(3) the Judicial Committee observed : \"The High Court (of Calcutta) approached the cases by considering first whether the assessee's family was a Hindu undivided family, and in the end left unanswered the question whether the income under assessment was the income of that family. This is due no doubt to the way in which the Commissioner had stated the questions. But, after all if the relevant Hindu law had been that the income belonged,.not to the assessee 5 I.T.R. 90 -L.R. 64 T. A. 28. (3) 3 I.T.R. 123. (2) 3 I.T. R. 367. himself, but to the assessee, his wife and daughter jointly, it is difficult to see how that association of individuals could have been refused the description \"Hindu joint family\"The Bombay High Court, on the other hand, inLaxminarayan's case having held that the see,his wife and mother were a Hindu undivided family, arrived too readily at the conclusion that the income was the income of the family.\" The Judicial Committee further observed \"Under Section 3 or Section 55 income is not to be attributed to any one of the five classes of persons mentioned by any loose or extended interpretation of the words, but only where the application of the words is warranted by their ordinary legal meaning . . . . In an extra legal sense, and even for some purposes of legal theory, ancestral property may perhaps be described, and usefully described, as family property; but it does not follow that in the eye of the Hindu law it belongs, save in certain circumstances, to the family as distinct from the individual. By reason of its origin a man's property may be liable to be divested wholly or in part on the happening of a particular event, or may be answerable for particular obligations, or may pass at his death in a particular way; but if, in spite of all such facts, his personal law regards him as the owner, the property as his property and the income therefrom as his income, it is chargeable to income-tax as his, i.e, as the income of an individual. In their Lordships' view it would not be in consonance with ordinary notions or with a correct interpretation of the law of the Mitakshara, to hold that property which a man has obtained from his father belongs to a Hindu undivided family by reason of his having a wife and daughters.\" The facts of the cases which were decided by the Judicial Committee need to be scrutinized carefully. Before the Judicial Committee there were six appeals by six partners of the firm Moolji Sicka: they were Moolji, Purshottam, Kalyanji, Chaturbhuj, Kanji and Sewdas. Moolji, Purshottam and Kalyanji had each a son or sons from whom he was not divided. But the income of the firm, which had to be assessed to super-tax was the separate income of each of these partners. Chaturbhuj had a wife and daughter but no son, and the income was his separate property. Kanji and Sewdas, sons of Moolji, were married men, but neither had a son : they received by gift from Moolji their respective interests in the firm, and for the purpose of the case it was assumed that the interest of each was ancestral property in which if he had a son the son would have taken an interest by birth. But no son having been born, the interest of Kanji and Sewdas in the property was not diminished or qualified. The Judicial Committee held that the wife and the daughters of a Hindu had right to maintenance out of his separate property as well as out of his coparcenary interest, but the mere existence of a wife or daughter did not make ancestral property in his hands joint. They observed : \"Interest' is a word of wide and vague significance, and no doubt it might be used of a wife's or daughter's right to be maintained which right accrues in the daughter's case on birth; but if the father's obligations are increased, his ownership is not divested, divided or impaired by marriage or the birth of a daughter. This is equally true of ancestral property belonging to himself alone as of self-acquired property.\" The Judicial Committee accordingly held that in none of the six appeals before them could the income falling to the shares of the partners of a registered firm be treated as income of a Hindu undivided family and assessed on that footing. In the view of the Judicial Committee, income received by four out of the six partners was their separate income: in the case of the remaining two partners the income was from sources which were ancestral. But merely because the source was held by a member who had received it from his father and was on that account ancestral, the income could not be deemed for purposes of assessment to be income of a Hindu undivided family, even though Kanji had a wife and a daughter, and Sewdas had a wife who had rights to be maintained under the Hindu law. In Gomedalli Lakshminarayan's case(1) the property was an- cestral in the hands of the father, and the son had acquired by birth an interest therein. There was a subsisting Hindu undivided family during the life-time of the father and that family did not come to an end on his death. On these facts the High Court of Bombay held that the income received from the property was (1) S I.T.R. 367. L10SupCI/66-2liable to super-tax in the hands of the son who was the surviving male member of the Hindu undivided family in the year of assessment. This distinction in the facts in the case then under discussion and the facts in Gomedalli Lakshminarayan's case(1) was not adverted to and the Board observed in Kalyanji Vithaldas's case (2) that the Bombay High Court \"arrived too readily at the conclusion that the income was the income of the family.\" When Gomedalli Lakshminarayan's case(1) was carried in appeal to the Judicial Committee, the Board regarded themselves as bound by the interpretation of the words \"Hindu undivided family\" employed in the Indian Income-tax Act in the case of Kalyanji Vithaldas (2) , and observed that since the facts of the case were not in any material respect different from the facts in the earlier case, the answer to the question referred should be that \"the income received by right of survivorship by the sole surviving male member of a Hindu undivided family can be taxed in the hands of such male member as his own individual income for the purpose of assessment to super-tax under section 55 of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922.\": Commissioner of Income-tax v. A. P. Swamy Go- medalli(8). It may however be recalled that in Kalyanji Vithaldas's case( 2 income assessed to tax belonged separately to four out of six partners : of the remaining two it was from an ancestral source but the fact that each such partner had a wife or daughter did not make that income from an ancestral source income of the undivided family of the partner, his wife and daughter. In Gomedalli Lakshminarayan's case(1) the property from which income accrued belonged to a Hindu undivided family and the effect of the death of the father who was a manager was merely to invest the rights of a manager upon the son. The income from the property was and continued to remain the income of the undivided family. Ibis distinction which had a vital bearing on the issue falling to be determined was not given effect to by the Judicial Committee in A. P. Swamy Gomedalli's case(3). A recent judgment of the Judicial Committee in a case aris- ing from Ceylon-Attorney-General of Ceylon v. A. R. Aruna- chalam Chetiar and Others (4 ) is in point. One Arunachalam a Nattukottai Chettiar and his son constituted a joint family governed by the Mitakshara School of Hindu law. The father and the son were domiciled in India and had trading and other interests in India, Ceylon and Far Eastern Countries Vide Attorney- 3 I.T. R. 367. (2) 5 I.T.R. 90-L.R. 64 I.A. 28. (3) 5 I.T.R. 416. (4) L.R. [1957] A.C. 540:34 I.T.R. Suppl. 42. General v. A. R. Arunachalam Chettiar (number 1)-(L.R.[1957] A. C. 513). The undivided son died in 1934 and Arunachalam became the sole surviving coparcener in a Hindu undivided family to which a number of female members belonged. Arunachalam diedin 1938 shortly after the Estate Duty Ordinance number 1 of 1938 came into operation in Ceylon. By section 73 of the Ordinance itwas provided that property passing on the death of a member of a Hindu undivided family was exempt from payment of estate duty. At all material times, the female members of the family had the right of maintenance and other rights which belonged to them as such members. The widows in the family including the widow of the predeceased son had also the power to introduce coparceners in the family by adoption, and that power was exercised after the death of Arunachalam."}, "annotations": [{"result": [{"value": {"start": 0, "end": 29, "text": "CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION:", "labels": ["NONE"]}}, {"value": {"start": 30, "end": 62, "text": "Civil Appeal number 328 of 1965.", "labels": ["NONE"]}}, {"value": {"start": 63, "end": 190, "text": "Appeal from the judgment and order dated June 20, 1962 of the Mysore High Court in Income-tax Reference Case number 15 of 1961.", "labels": ["NONE"]}}, {"value": {"start": 191, "end": 246, "text": "K.

Reasons, good and substantial, exist for directing the petitioner to approach the concerned High Court in the first instance instead of knocking at the doors of this Court straightaway. And these need to be spelled out. An illustration may tell more effectively, what other- wise may not be told as effectively, and perhaps, only with some embarrassment. Suppose there is only one National Hospital established especially for performing open-heart surgery which cannot be performed elsewhere in any of the eighteen Regional Hospitals. What will happen to the pa- tients needing such surgery, if the National Hospital which alone is specially equipped for this type of surgery, throws its doors wide open also for patients suffering from other ailments who can be treated by any and every one of the eighteen Regional Hospitals? More particularly when the patients already admitted for such surgery by the National Hospital are already lying unattended to on its floors, and in its corridors, for an unconscionably long time? Showing sympathy for a patient with other than a heart problem who can also be treated equally effectively, and perhaps much more quickly, may well constitute cruelty to the heart patients who can be treated only by the National Hospital established especially and exclusively for the treatment of such patients. Will it not be more merciful to all concerned (by being firm enough) to tell those suffering from other than heart problems to go to Regional Hospitals, instead of insisting on being treated at the National Hospital, which also can of course treat them, but only at the cost of neglecting the heart patients who have nowhere else to go'? More so as the patients going to the Regional Hospital may well benefit much more by securing more personalized and urgent attention thereat. On the other hand, not to do so many well amount to being engaged in trying to relieve the distress of those whose distress can beremoved by any one else at the cost of refusing to treat those who cannot be treated by any one else. If this Court takes upon itself to do everything which even the High Courts can do, this Court will not be able to do what this Court alone can do under article 136 of the Con- stitution of India, and other provisions conferring exclu- sive jurisdiction on this Court. There is no reason to assume that the concerned High Court will not do justice. Or that this Court alone can do justice. If this Court enter- tains Writ Petitions at the instance of parties who approach this Court directly instead of approaching the concerned High Court in the first instance, tens of thousands of Writ Petitions would in course of time be instituted in this Court directly. The inevitable result will be that the arrears pertaining to matters in respect of which this Court exercises exclusive jurisdiction under the Constitution will assume more alarming proportions. As it is, more than ten years old Civil Appeals and Criminal Appeals are sobbing for attention. It will occasion great misery and immense hard- ship to tens of thousands of litigants if the seriousness of this aspect is not sufficiently realized. And this is no imaginary phobia. A dismissed government servant has to wait for nearly ten years for redress in this Court.' A litigant whose appeal has been dismissed by wrongly refusing to condone delay has to wait for 14 years before his wrong is righted by this Court.2 The time for imposing self-disci- pline has already come, even if it involves shedding of some amount of institutional-ego, or raising of some eye-brows. Again, it is as important to do justice at this level, as to inspire confidence in the litigants that justice will be meted out to them at the High Court level, and other levels. Faith must be inspired in the hierarchy of Courts and the institution as a whole. Not only in this Court alone. And this objective can be achieved only by this Court showing trust in the High Court by directing the litigants to ap- proach the High Court in the first instance. Besides, as a matter of fact, if matters like the present one are insti- tuted in the High Court, there is a likelihood of the same being disposed of much more quickly, and equally effective- ly, on account of the decentralisation of the process of administering justice. We are of the opinion that the peti- tioner should be directed to adopt this course and approach the High Court. * More than 9000 are already pending now. 1. Kashinath Dikshita v.

It needs to be clarified that it will be open to the High Court to call upon the petitioner to present a properly framed Writ Petition without obliging him to incur the legal and other incidental expenditure if the petitioner cannot afford the same. The matter may in such an event be assigned to a learned Advocate practicing in the High Court through the State Legal Aid and Assistance Board, or through the High Court Legal Aid Committee which can provide him with the requisite funds to enable him to do the needful. It will also be open to the High Court to request the learned Dis- trict Judge of Vadodara to look into the matter from the point of view of the complaints made in the letter in ques- tion, and make an appropriate report to enable the High Court to pass such suitable orders as may be called for in the facts and circumstances of the case in order to secure ends of justice.

Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order December 12, 1962, of the Mysore High Court in W.P. number 531 of 1961. Bishan Narain, Naunit Lal and B.R.G.K. Achar, for the appellant. S. K. Venkataranga Iyengar and R. Gopalakrishnan, for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by Satyanarayana Raju, J. This appeal, by special leave, raises a somewhat important question of all, which is whether the reversion of a Government servant from an officiating post to his substantive post, while his junior is officiating in the higher post, does not, by itself, constitute a reduction in rank within the meaning of article 311(2) of the Constitution. For the purpose of deciding the point raised in the appeal, it would be necessary to state the material facts. The Southern Railway has two grades of Train Examiners, one in the scale of Rupees 100-5-125-6-185 and the other in the scale of Rupees 150-225. The respondent was employed in the lower scale as a Train Examiner. By an order dated April 7, 1959, the respondent was promoted to officiate in the higher scale with a starting salary of Rupees 150 per month. That order read as follows : \"2. Sri S. Raghavendrachar, TXR-YPR in scale Rupees 100-185 is promoted to officiate as TXR in scale Rupees 150-225 on Rupees 150 per month and retained YPR as TXR-IC. 185 is promoted to officiate as TXR in scale Rupees 150- 225 on Rupees 150 per month and transferred to SBC-BG vide item above. Sanction endorsed by D.S. for promotion of items 2 and 3.\" There is a note appended to the order which is important \"Note: 1. The promotion of items 2 and 3 are purely provisional subject to revision when Divisional Seniority lists are drawn up.\" By an order dated November 27, 1959, the respondent was reverted. ]Mat order was as follows : \"Sri S. Raghavendrachar, TXR/YPR (officiating) in scale Rupees 150-225 is reverted to scale Rupees 100-185 on Rupees 130 per month and transferred to SBC/MG.\" On receipt of this order, the respondent made representations to the appellant. The appellant sent to the respondent communication dated May 25, 1960 : \"As per the existing instructions an officiating employee with less than 18 months of service in the higher grade may be reverted to lower scale without assigning any reason for such reversion by a competent authority. Since the period of your officiating in scale Rupees 150225 was less than 18 months and since your reversion from scale Rupees 150-225 to Rupees 100-185 has been ordered by a competent authority, no reasons need be assigned as requested in your representation dated 8th/9th December 1959. As regards the confirmation of TXRs in scale Rupees 150-225, who were your juniors while you were officiating in scale Rupees 150-225, 1 have to advise you that consequent on your reversion to scale Rupees 100-185, all your juniors, in scale Rupees 150-225, have become your seniors and their confirmations in preference to you are in order. Regarding your re-promotion to scale Rupees 150- 225, it will be considered in the normal course according to your, seniority and suitability to hold the post in scale Rupees 150- 225.\" The respondent made a further appeal to the Divisional Superintendent, Mysore, on July 2, 1960 and sent him two reminders. Not having got any response, he filed an appeal on January 31, 1961, to the General Manager, Southern Railway. The respondent sent a reminder to the latter on March 31, 1961. In reply, the Divisional Personnel Officer wrote to the respondent as follows by letter dated April 30, 1961 : Rupees 150-225 (PS) was not a penalty as presumed by you, in your above representations. The vacancy thus released by you in scale Rupees 150- 225 (PS) and the vacancies which existed on the date of your reversion were filled up on 14th February 1960. You are therefore eligible to be considered for promotion against a vacancy which occurred after the date of your reversion and not against the vacancies which existed on the date of your reversion and also the vacancy caused by your reversion. No regular vacancy (other than short term leave vacancy) in scale Rupees 150-225 has occurred from the date of your reversion till date. You will therefore be considered for promotion against the next vacancy, subject to the condition of seniority-cum- suitability, on the basis of which only promotions to non-selection posts are to be ordered. 2. As regards seniority, all those hitherto promoted to scale Rupees 150-225 (PS) will automatically rank seniors to you and your seniority if promoted will be reckoned only from the date of your promotion in future vacancy. 3. Your contention that, when you were promoted to officiate for 2 months against the leave vacancy of Shri Venkataraman, as per this office order number M. 542/PI of 14th November 1960, you should have been continued even after the expiry of the leave vacancy, and that Shri Varghese should have been reverted, is not correct, for the reasons stated in paragraph 2 above. 4. Your representation of 30th January 1961 to GM(P) Madras is therefore withheld.\" Aggrieved by the order dated November 27, 1959, the res- pondent moved the Mysore High Court, on the failure of his representations to the hierarchy of Departmental Heads, for a writ of certiorari to quash the impugned order made by the appellant. By judgment dated December 12, 1962, a Division Bench of the High Court quashed the order of reversion. The High Court observed that it was not necessary to express any opinion on the question whether the reversion of the respondent on the ground that his work was unsatisfactory amounted to a reductionin rank within the meaning of that expression occurring in article 311(2) of the Constitution. But the High Court held that the reversion of the respondent amounted to a reduction in rank because he was reverted from the higher post to the lower post notwithstanding the fact that his juniors were still retained in the higher posts. In reaching this conclusion the High Court purported to follow the decision of this Court in Madhav Laxman Vaikunthe v. State of Mysore(.). The Divisional Personnel Officer, Southern Railway, Mysore,obtained special leave from this Court against the order of the High Court. It is contended by Mr. Bishan Narain, learned counsel for the appellant, that the High Court misunderstood the ratio of the judgment of this Court in Vaikunthe's case(1), that there is no right in a Government servant to promotion as of right, that the mere reversion of a Government servant from an officiating post to his substantive post, notwithstanding that his juniors are retained in the higher posts, does not amount to a reduction in rank and the provisions of art. 311(2) are not attracted. On the other hand, it is contended by Mr. S. K. Venkataranga lyengar, learned counsel for the respondent, that the circumstances of the case clearly indicated that the reversion of the respondent amounted to a reduction in rank and since the procedure prescribed by article 311(2) was not complied with, the order of reversion was bad in law. It may be taken to be settled by the decisions of this Court that since article 311 makes no distinction between permanent and temporary posts, its protection must be held to extend to all government servants holding permanent or temporary posts or officiating in any of them, but that protection is limited to the imposition of three major penalties contemplated by the Service Rules, viz., dismissal or removal or reduction in rank. The first of the cases which may be considered is the decision in Parshotam Lal Dhingra v. Union of India(2), Commonly known as Dhingra's case. In this case, Das C.J., who spoke for the majority, considered comprehensively the scope and effect of the relevant constitutional provisions, service rules and their impact on the question as to whether reversion of Dhingra offended against the provisions of art. 311(2). Dhingra was appointed as a Signaller in 1924 and promoted to the post of Chief Controller in 1950. Both these posts were in Class III Service. In (1) [1962] 1 SCR. 886. (2) [1958] S.C.R. 828. 1951, he was appointed to officiate in Class II Service as Assistant Superintendent, Railway Telegraphs. On certain adverse remarks having been made against him, he was reverted as a subordinate till he made good his 'short comings. Then, Dhingra made a representation. Subsequently, the General Manager gave him notice reverting him to Class III appointment. It was this order-which was challenged by Dhingra by a writ petition, in the High Court and, eventually, in this Court. The question for decision was whether the order of the General Manager amounted to reduction in rank within the meaning of article 311(2) of the Constitution, and Dhingra was entitled to a reasonable opportunity to show cause against the order. This Court held that the reversion of an officiating officer to his substantive post did not attract the provisions of art. 311(2) and that Dhingra was not entitled to the protection of that article. It is however true that even an officiating government servant may be reverted to his original rank by way of punishment. It was therefore observed in Dhingra's case(\") at p. 863 : \"Thus if the order entails or provides for the forfeiture of his pay or allowances or the loss of his seniority in his substantive rank or the stoppage or postponement of his future chances of promotion, then that circumstance may indicate that although in form the Gov- ernment had purported to exercise its right to terminate the employment or to reduce the servant to a lower rank under the terms of the contract of employment or under the rules, in truth and reality the Government has terminated the employment as and by way of penalty.\" One test for determining whether the termination of service was by way of punishment or otherwise is to ascertain whether under the Service Rules, but for such termination, the servant has the right to hold the post. It was held in Dhingrads case(1) that he was holding an officiating post and had no right under the rules of the Railway Code to continue in it, that under the general law such appointment was terminable at any time on reasonable notice and the reduction could not operate as a forfeiture of any right, that the order of the General Manager visited him with no evil consequences and that the order therefore did no\", amount to a reduction in rank. (1) (1958] S.C.R. 828. Vaikunthe's case(1) was relied upon by the High Court in support of its conclusion that the reversion of the respondent amounted to a reduction in rank. It is therefore necessary to scrutinize the facts of that case. The appellant Vaikunthe, who held the rank of a Mamlatdar in the first grade, and was officiating as District Deputy Collector, was alleged to have wrongly charged travelling allowance for 59 miles instead of 51 and was, as the result of a Departmental enquiry, reverted to his substantive rank for three years and directed to refund the excess he had charged. He made a representation to the Government which was of no avail although the Accountant General was of the opinion that the appellant had not over-charged and committed no fraud. Ultimately, the appellant was promoted to the Selection Grade but the order of reversion remained effective and affected his position in the Selection Grade. After retirement he brought a suit for a declaration that the order of reversion was void and for recovery of a certain sum as arrears of salary and allowances. The trial Court held that there was no compliance with the provisions of S. 240(3) of the Government of India Act, 1935, granted the declaration but refused the arrears claimed. Vaikunthe filed an appeal and the State a cross-objection. The High Court dismissed the appeal and allowed the cross-objection, holding that the order of reversion was not a punishment within the meaning of S. 240(3) of the 1935 Act. This Court held that the matter was covered by the observations in Dhingra's case(1) and the tests of punishment laid down by this Court viz., (1) whether the servant had a right to the rank or (2) whether he had been visited with evil consequences of the kind specified therein, and that the second test certainly applied. This Court concluded that Vaikunthe might or might not have the right to hold the higher post, but there could be no doubt that he was visited with evil consequences as a result of the order of reversion. It was there held : \"Mere deprivation of higher emoluments, however, in consequence of an order of, reversion could not by itself satisfy that test which must include such other consequences as forfeiture of substantive pay and loss of seniority.\" Since the requirement of section 240(3) of the 1935 Act, which corresponds to article 311(2) of the Constitution, had not been found to have been fully complied with, the order of reversion was held to be void. (1) [1962] 1 S.C.R. 886. (2) [1958] S.C.R. 828.There was an important aspect of this decision which was lost sight of by the High Court. The impugned order there ran as follows : \"After careful consideration Government have decided to revert you to Mamlatdar for a period of three years........ It was pointed out in Dhingra's case(-) that if the order of reversion entailed or provided for the forfeiture of the pay or allowances of the Government servant or loss of his seniority in his substantive rank or the stoppage or postponement of his future chances of promotion, then that circumstance might 'Indicate that although in form the Government had purported to exercise its right to terminate the employment or to reduce the servant to a lower rank under the terms of the contract of employment or under the rules, in truth and reality the Government had terminated the employment as and by way of penalty. At p. 891, Sinha, C.J., who spoke for the Court, pointed out: he would have continued as a Deputy Collector but for the Order of the Government, dated August 11, 1948, impugned in this case, as a result of the enquiry held against him, and that his reversion was not as a matter of course or for administrative convenience. The Order, in terms, held him back for three years. (Italics ours). Thus his emoluments, present as well as future, were adversely affected by the Order aforesaid of the Government. In the ordinary course, he would have continued as a Deputy Collector with all the emoluments of the post and would have been entitled to further promotion but for the set back in his service as a result of the adverse finding against him which finding was ultimately declared by the Accountant General to have been under a misapprehension of the true facts. It is true that he was promoted as a result of the Government Order dated March 26, 1951, with effect from August 1, 1950. But that promotion did not entirely cover the ground lost by him as a result of the Government Order impugned in this case.\" Again, at p. 893, the learned Chief Justice pointed out\"If the loss of the emoluments attaching to the higher rank in which he was officiating was the only consequence of his reversion as a result of the enquiry against him, the appellant would have no cause of (1) [1958] S.C. 828. action. But it is clear that as a result of the Order dated August 11, 1948 (Ex 35), the appellant lost his seniority as a Mamlatdar, which was his substantive post. That being so, it was not a simple case of reversion with no evil consequences; it had such consequences as would come within the test of punishment as laid down in Dhingra's case.\" Finally, it was pointed out : \"If the reversion had not been for a period of three years, it could not be Said that the appellant had been punished within the meaning of the rule laid down in Dhingra's Case. It cannot be asserted that his reversion to a substantive post for a period of three years was not by way of punishment. From the facts of this case it is clear that the appellant was on the upward move in the cadre of his service and but for this aberration in his progress to a higher post, he would have, in ordinary course, been promoted as he actually was some time later when the authorities realised perhaps that he had not been justly treated...... The real ground on which Vaikunthe's reversion to his original post of Mamlatdar was held to be a violation of his Constitutional grantee was that his chances of promotion were irrevocably barred for a period of three years. If this aspect of Vaikunthe's case(1) is borne in mind, it will be found that there is no basic inconsistency between the decisions which have a bearing on the question as to in what cases reversion would amount to a reduction in rank. Even so, it is contended by learned counsel for the respon- dent that the real reason which operated on the mind of the appellant was that the respondent's work in his officiating capacity was unsatisfactory. Assuming that to be so, the question is whether his reversion to his original post, because he was found unsuitable for the higher rank to which he had been given the officiating chance, is valid. In State of Bombay v. F. A. Abraham(2) the respondent held the substantive post of Inspector of Police and had been officiating as Deputy Superintendent of Police. He was reverted to his original rank without being given an opportunity of being heard in respect of the reversion. His request to furnish him with reasons for his reversion was refused. Later, a departmental (1)[1962]1 S.C.R.886. (2) [1962] Supp. 2 S.C.R. 92.enquiry was held behind his back in regard to certain allegations of misconduct made against him in a confidential communication from the District Superintendent of Police to the Deputy Inspector-General of Police, but these allegations were not proved at the enquiry. The Inspector- General of Police, however, thereafter wrote to the Government that the respondent's previous record was not satisfactory and that he had been promoted to officiate as Deputy Superintendent of Police in the expectation that he would turn a new leaf. The High Court held, following its earlier decision in M. A. I. Waheed v. State of Madhya Pradesh(1) that if a person officiating in a higher post is reverted to his original post in the normal course, that is, on account of cessation of the vacancy or his failure to acquire the required qualification, the reversion did not amount to a reduction in rank but if he is reverted for unsatisfactory work, then the reversion would amount to a reduction in rank. This Court did not agree with the ob- servations in Waheed's case(1) that when a person officiating in a post s reverted for unsatisfactory work, that reversion would amount to a reduction in rank. This Court took the view that the Government had a right to consider the suitability of the respondent to hold the position to which he had been appointed to officiate and that it was entitled for that purpose to make inquiries about his suitability and that was all what the Government had done in that case. Two more cases cited at the Bar now require to be consider- ed. In The High Court, Calcutta v. Amal Kumar Roy (2) this Court held that the word 'rank' in article 311(2) referred to classification and not to a particular place in the same cadre in the hierarchy of service. The facts of the case were as follows. The respondent was a Munsif in the West Bengal Civil Service (Judicial). When the cases of several Munsifs came up for consideration before the High Court for inclusion in the panel of officers to officiate as Subordinate Judges, the respondent's name was excluded.On a representation made by him, the respondent was told by the Registrar of the High Court that the Court had decided to consider his case after a year. As a result of such exclu- sion, the respondent, who was then the senior most in the list of Munsifs, lost eight places in the cadre of Subordinate Judges before he was actually appointed to act as an Additional Subordinate Judge. His case mainly was that this exclusion by the High Court amounted in law to the penalty of 'withholding of promotion' without giving him an opportunity to show cause. He pray- (1) [1954] Nag. L.J. 305. (2) [1963] 1 S.C.R. 437 ed that a declaration might be made that he occupied the same position in respect of seniority in the cadre of Subordinate Judges as he would have done if no supersession had taken place and claimed arrears of salary, in a suit filed by him. The trial Court decreed the suit. On behalf of the appellants a preliminary objection was taken in this Court that the controversy raised was not justiciable. This Court held that there was no cause of action for the suit and the appeal must succeed. It was there contended on behalf of the respondent that even though there, might not have been any disciplinary proceed- ings taken against him, the effect of the High Court's order was that he was reduced by eight places in the list of Subordinate Judges and that in law amounted to a reduction in rank within the meaning of article 311 (2) of the Constitution. At p. 453 it was pointed out as follows : \"In our opinion, there is no substance in this contention because losing places in the same cadre, namely, of Subordinate Judges does not amount to a reduction in rank within the meaning of article 311(2). The plaintiff sought to argue that 'rank', in accordance with dictionary meaning, signifies 'relative position or status or place, according to Oxford English Dictionary. The word 'rank' can be and has been used in different senses in different contexts. The expression 'rank' in article 3 1 1 (2) has reference to a person's classification and not his particular place in the same cadre in the hierarchy of the service to which be belongs. Hence, in the context of the Judicial Service of West Bengal, 'reduc- tion in rank' would imply that a person who is already holding the post of a Subordinate Judge has been reduced to the position of a Munsif, the rank of a Subordinate Judge being higher than that of a Munsif. But Subordinate Judges in the same cadre hold the same rank though they have to be listed in order of seniority in the Civil List. Therefore, losing some places in the seniority list is not tantamount to reduction in rank. Hence, it must be held that the, provision-, of art. 311 (2) of the Constitution are not attracted to this case.\" This decision therefore is authority for the position that losing some places in the seniority list is not tantamount to reduction in rankThe respondent relied upon the decision of this Court in P. C. Wadhwa v. Union of India(1). There, the appellant, a member of the Indian Police Service and holding the substantive rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police (a post in the junior time scale of pay) in the State of Punjab, was promoted to officiate as Superintendent of Police, which was a post carrying a higher salary in the senior time-scale, and posted as Additional Superintendent of Police. After he had earned one increment in that post, he was served with a charge-sheet and before the enquiry, which had been ordered, had started, he was reverted to his substantive rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police, the ground suggested for reversion being unsatisfactory conduct. No details of the unsatisfactory conduct were specified and the appellant was not asked for any explanation. At the time when the appellant was reverted officers junior to him in the I.P.S. Cadre of the State were officiating in the senior scale. The order entailed loss of pay as well as loss of seniority and postponement of future chances of promotion. It was held that the order of reversion made against the appellant was in effect a 'reduction in rank' within the meaning of article 311(2) of the Constitution and inasmuch as he was given no opportunity of showing cause against the said order of reversion, there was violation of article 311. On a consideration of the circumstances of the case, this Court reached the conclusion that the action of the Government reverting the appellant was mala fide. But that was not the sole ground on which the order of reversion was held to be bad. After an examination of the legal position from the large body of rules to which reference was made, it was held that in so far as the Indian Police Service is concerned there was only one cadre, that appointment to posts borne on that cadre were to be made by direct recruitment except to the extent of 25 per cent of the senior posts which may be filled by promotion from the State Police Service. A special feature of the All India Services like the Indian Police Service and the Indian Civil Service is that pro- motion is a matter of right. It was for this reason that this Court, by a majority pointed out at p. 622 that in the case of' those services there was no rule which, specifically provided that an officer had to be freshly appointed to a post carrying a salary in the senior scale of pay. (1) [1964] 4 S.C.R. 598.At p. 627 it was said \"In our opinion, the whole scheme of the rules indicates that a person borne on the junior scale of pay has a right to hold a post on the senior scale of pay depending upon the availability of, a post and his seniority in the junior scale of pay.... If a person hold- ing a post in the senior scale, though in an officiating capacity, is found to be unfit to hold that post, action will have to be taken against him as required by r. 5 of Discipline and Appeal Rules because his reversion to a post in the lower scale would amount to reduction in rank within the meaning of art. 311 of the Constitution.\" On a consideration of the circumstances of that case, it is clear that the decision itself proceeded on the basic fact that for members of All India Services like the Indian Police Service, promotion was a matter of right and special considerations would have to be applied to them. Now, in the light of the principles established by the above decisions, we may consider the respondent's case. The Southern Railway has two grades of Train Examiners. The respondent and one James Blazey were promoted from the lower grade to officiate in the higher grade. The respondent was shown at item number 2 and James Blazey at item number 3 in the promotion list. A note was appended to the order that the promotion of the respondent and Blazey were 'purely provisional subject to revision when seniority lists were drawn up for the Division'. By reason of the order dated November 27, 1959, the respondent was reverted to the lower grade while Blazey was retained in the higher grade. The case of the respondent is that Blazey was junior to him and that since he was reverted while Blazey was not, it would amount to a reduction in rank so far as he was concerned. It is plain that what he complains of is that he lost his seniority by reason of the retention of Blazey in the officiating higher post. The respondent's rank in the substantive post i.e., in the lower grade, was in no way affected by this. In the substantive grade, the respondent retained his rank. It may also be added that he was visited with no penal consequences. It is no doubt true that it is not the form but the substance that matters, but once it is accepted that the respondent has no right to the post to which he was provisionally promoted, there can be no doubt that his reversion does not amount to a reduction in rank.None of the decisions considered above lends support to the contention for the respondent. It was finally argued that the procedure prescribed by rr. 1609 to 1619 of the rules contained 'in the Indian Railway Establishment Code, Vol. I., were contravened. Rule 1609 reads \"As a general rule, in no circumstances, should a gazetted railway servant be kept in ignorance for any length of time that his superiors, after sufficient experience of his work, are dissatisfied with him; where a warning might eradicate a particular fault, the advantages of prompt communication are obvious. On the other hand, the communication of any adverse remarks removed from their context is likely to give a misleading impression to the gazetted railway servant concerned. The procedure detailed in rule 1610 should therefore be followed.\" Rules 1609 to 1618 apply only to gazetted railway servants. 'Me respondent is not a gazetted railway servant and there is no question of his claiming that he is entitled to the right given under the above rules. Rule 1619 refers to non-gazetted railway servants. That rule Provides that in general conformity with the principles laid down in the preceding rules applicable to Gazetted Railway Servants, a General Manager may frame detailed rules for the preparation, submission and disposal of confidential reports on non-gazetted railway servants. Learned counsel for the respondent could not place before us those rules, if any. The contentions raised by the respondent having been nega- tived, this appeal must succeed, and it is accordingly allowed, but, in the circumstances of the case, there will be no order as to costs.

Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated September 10, 1965 of the Allahabad High Court in Civil Miscellaneous Writ number 3567 of 1965. Niren De, Additional Solicitor-General and N. H. Hingorani, for the appellant. R.K. Garg, D. K. Agarwala and M. V. Goswami, for respon- dent number 1. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Vaidialingam, L In this appeal, by special leave, the short question, that arises for consideration, is as to whether the appellant railway is entitled to claim exemption from payment of terminal tax, under item 2, of Schedule B, of the rules framed by the Municipal Board of Saharanpur. The appellant will be so entitled, if it is held to be 'a railway', as contended, on behalf of the appellant. The High Court of Allahabad, in its order and judgment, under appeal, has held that the appellant is not a railway, but only a tramway and, as such, not eligible for exemption, from the tax, in question. The short facts, leading to this appeal, may now be briefly set out. The appellant is a limited liability company; and it runs a railway, between Shahdara, in Delhi, and Saharanpur, in the State of Uttar Pradesh-a distance of about 95 miles or 148.865 kilo meters. The appellant company also operates within the municipal area of Saharanpur. The company was, originally, registered as a tramway, under the Indian Tramways Act, 1886 (Act XI of 1886) (hereinafter called the Tramways Act), on November 20, 1905. By Notification, number 5752, dated July 5, 1907, the Governor General in Council extended to the appellant company, the whole of the Indian Railways Act, 1890 (Act I of 1890) (hereinafter called the Railways Act), excepting the provisions of Section 135. The Municipal Board of Saharanpur, the first respondent herein, imposes a terminal tax, under the provisions of s. 128(1)(xiii) of the United Provinces Municipalities Act, 1916, as amended by Act I of 1918. Under the said Act, the first respondent has prohibited the importation of goods, within the local limits of the Saharanpur Municipality, by rail, until the tax leviable thereon, or in respect thereof, has been paid, in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the Rules. The Board has also framed rules for the assessment and collection of Terminal Tax, as authorized by the Government Notification number 856/XI-D.T. 3, dated May 1, 1919. The rules have been amended, as per another notification, number 5965/XI-D.T. 3, dated September 21, 1939. Item 2, of Schedule B, of, these rules, provides for a list of articles being exempted from payment of Terminal Tax. The said item is as follows : \"Railway stores and materials, which are required for use on Railways, whether in construction, maintaining or working the same and which are not removed outside the Railway land boundaries but not stores imported into Municipal limits for purchase and consumption by Railway employees nor stores with which Railway Cooperative Stores are stocked for sale to Member.\" It is the claim of the appellant that, till 1961, the first respondent has never imposed any terminal tax, on 'railway stores and materials' required for use on the railway of the appellant company, for the purposes mentioned in item 2 of Schedule B. But, for the first time, in January 1962, according to the appellant, the first respondent imposed tax on such stores and attempted to make the appellant liable. The appellant company protested against this levy, on the ground that, it being a railway, was entitled to the exemption provided in respect of 'railway stores and materials, which are required for use on railway'. But, the first respondent, by its order, dated October 11, 1962, over-ruled the appellant's objections in this regard. An appeal, taken by the appellant company, to the Additional District Magistrate, Saharanpur, under section 160 of the Municipalities Act, read with the relevant Rules, did not meet with success, as the said Magistrate rejected the appeal, by his order dated May 25, 1965. The appellant company filed Civil Miscellaneous Writ number 3567 of 1965, in the High Court of Allahabad, challenging the levy of terminal tax and claimed exemption, under item 2, of Schedule B, referred to earlier. The learned Judges of the Allahabad High Court, by their judgment, dated September 10, 1965, dismissedthe writ petition. They were of the view that the appellant company was not 'a railway', but 'a tramway' constructed tinder the Tramways Act. In this connection, the learned Judges adverted to the Railways Act, which defines both the terms 'tramway' and ' railway'. It is their view that when a tramway and a railway, are both separately defined in an Act, a tramway cannot also be a railway. The learned Judges, of the High Court, then referred to the fact that so far as the appellant company was concerned, the Central Government had not applied section 135 of the Railways Act, though all the other provisions of that Act had been applied. They further held that a mere application of the Railways Act, in whole or in part, to a tramway, will not convert the tramway into a railway and that, in order to be a railway, it has to be opened, in accordance with the provisions contained in Chapter IV, of the Railways Act. So, they concluded that, inasmuch as the appellant railway was not opened, in accordance with the provisions of the Railways Act, it had been, from its inception, and it continued to be, not a railway, but only a tramway. On this line of reasoning, the High Court further held that in the rules framed by the Municipal Board, the expression 'railway' must be intended to refer only to 'railways' coming under the Railways Act, and could not include a 'tramway', like the appellant, opened under the Tramways Act. In consequence, the claim of the appellant, for exemption, was, according to the High Court, rightly rejected by the authorities. The result was the dismissal of the appellant's writ petition, by the High Court. We shall now refer to the main features of the appellant company. The appellant railway is worked by steam, or other mechanical power, and is not wholly within a Municipal area. The railway line comprises narrow gauge track of 2 6\" gauge, and consists of main line, transportation sidings and commercial sidings. 'Me line passes through four districts viz. Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut and Delhi, within the provinces of Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. The system has about 155 level crossings, comprising of Special Class, A- class, B-class and C-class. Some of the level crossings are provided with signalling and interlocking arrangements and the system takes in 406 bridges, and 26 railway stations' in all. The bridges and culverts are maintained, in accordance with the instructions contained in 'Way and Works Manual' of the Indian Railways, and the railway stations are fitted with Morse speakers and instruments, for working trains, as per general rules applicable to all railways. There is annual inspection of the railway line, by the Additional Commissioner of Railways Safety, appointed by the Government, to inspect Indian Railways. There are -arrangements for through booking of goods and passengers. From what is stated above, it will be seen that the appellant company is a 'railway', as commonly understood, and described in ordinary parlance. The Tramways Act was an Act passed to facilitate the con- struction and to regulate the working of Tramways. Section 3(5) defines 'tramway' as follows :- \" 'tramway' means a tramway having one, two or more rails, and includes- (a)any part of a tramway, or any siding, turnout, connection, line or track belonging to a tramway; (b) any electrical equipment of a tramway; and (c) any electric supply-line transmitting power from a generating station or sub-station to a tramway or from a generating station to a sub- station from which power is transmitted to a tramway.\" The expression 'order', under section 3(6), means an order authorizing the construction of a tramway under the Act, and includes a further Order substituted for, or amending, extending or varying, that order. There are various other provisions in this Act relating to the construction and maintenance of tramways, orders authorizing the construction of tramways, and other incidental matters. The Railways Act was an Act to consolidate, amend and add to the law relating to Railways in India. Section 3(1) defines 'tramway' as meaning a tramway constructed under the Tramways Act. or any special Act relating to tramways. Section 3(4) defines 'railways' and is as follows \" railway' means a railway, or any portion of a railway, for the public carriage of passengers, animals or goods, and includes- (a)all land within the fences or other boundary marks indicating the limits of the land appurtenant to a railway; (b)all lines of rails, sidings or branches worked over for thepurposes of, or in connection with, a railway; (c)all stations, offices, warehouses, wharves, work-shops,manufactories, fixed plant and machinery and other works constructed for the purposes of, or in connection with, a railway; and (d) all ferries, ships, boats and rafts which are used on inland waters for the purposes of the traffic of a railway and belong to or are hired or worked by the autho- rity administering the railway.\"This Act also contains various provisions relating to the opening of railways, inspection of railways, construction and maintenance of works, working of railways and several other incidental matters. Section 135, occurring in Chapter X, containing supplemental provisions, relates to taxation of railways by local authorities. That section reads : \" 135. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any enactment, or in any agreement or award based on any enactment, the following rules shall regulate the levy of taxes in respect of railways and from railway adminis- trations in aid of the funds of local authorities, namely :- (1)A railway administration shall not be liable to pay any tax in aid of the funds of any local authority unless the Central Government has, by notification in the Official Gazette, declared the railway administration to be liable to pay the tax. (2)While a notification of the Central Government under clause (1) of this section is in force, the railway administration shall be liable to pay to the local authority either the tax mentioned in the notification or, in lieu thereof, such sum, if any, as an officer appointed in this behalf by the Central Government may, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, from time to time determine to be fair and reasonable. (3)The Central Government may at any time re- voke or vary a notification under clause (1) of this section. (4)Nothing in this section is to be construed as debarring any railway administration from entering into a contract with any local authority for the supply of water or light, or for the scavenging of railway premises, or for any other service which the local authority may be rendering or be prepared to render within any part of the local area under its control. (5)'Local authority' in this section means a local authority as defined in the General Clauses Act, 1887, and includes any authority legally entitled to or entrusted with the control or management of any fund for the maintenance of watchmen or for the conservancy of a river.\" The point to be noted, in this provision, is that unless a notification has been issued by the Central Government, under sub-section (1) of section 135, declaring a railway administration to be liable to pay a tax, a railway administration shall not be liable to pay any tax inaid of the funds of any local authority. Section 146, giving power to the Government to extend the Railways Act to certain tramways, is as follows: \"146. (1) This Act or any portion thereof may be extended by notification in the Official Gazette (a) to any tramway which is wholly within a municipal area or which is declared not to be a railway under clause (20) of article 366 of the Constitution, by the State Government; and (b) to any other tramway, by the Central Government. (2) This section does not apply to any tramway not worked by steam or other mechanical power.\" We have already pointed out that all the provisions of the Railways Act, except section 135, have been extended to the appellant company. The next enactment to be referred to is the Indian Railway Companies Act, 1895 (Act X of 1895), which provided for the payment, by railway companies, registered under the Indian Companies Act, 1 882, of interest out of capital during construction. Section 2(1) defines 'railway' as meaning a railway as defined in section 3, clause (4) of the Railways Act. Section 3 provided for a railway company paying interest on its paid-up share capital, out of capital, for the period, and subject to the conditions and restrictions contained in that section. There are other consequential provisions, in this Act. The Indian Tramways Act, 1902 (Act IV of 1902) was one to apply the provisions of the Indian Railway Companies Act, 1895, to certain tramway companies. The preamble to this Act IV of 1902, stated that it was expedient to apply the provisions of the Indian Railway Companies Act, 1895, to companies formed for the construction of tramways 'not differing in structure and working from light railways'. This preamble will clearly show that, even as early as 1902, the Legislature considered that though certain systems were called 'tramways, substantially they did not differ, in structure and working, from light railways. The expression 'railway' is defined, in s. 311(2) of the Government of India Act, 1935, as follows :- \" railway' includes a tramway not wholly within a municipal area.\" It is to be noted that if a system, though a tramway, is wholly not within a municipal area, that system will be a 'railway'. Entry58, of List 1 (Federal List) of the Seventh Schedule to the 1935 Act, was : \"Terminal taxes on goods or passengers carried by railway or air; taxes on railway fares and freights.\" It is, again, to be noted, that under this Entry, in respect of a tramway, which is not wholly within a municipal area and which will, therefore, be a 'railway', under section 311(2), the levy of terminal tax on goods or passengers carried by such a system, will be within the competence of the Federal Legislature. Under article 366(20) of the Constitution, the expression 'rai lway' is dealt with, as follows : \" railway' does not include- (a) a tramway wholly within a municipal area, or (b) any other line of communication wholly situate in one State and declared by Parliament by law not to be a railway.\" It may be noted here that the appellant's system does not come within the exclusions mentioned in cls. (a) or (b) of this definition. Entry 89 of List 1 (Union List), of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, is as follows : \"Terminal taxes on goods or passengers, carried by railway, sea or air; taxes on railway fares and freights.\"' It may be noted that the competent legislative body to levy terminal taxes on goods or passengers, carried by the appellant's system, which will be a 'railway', under Art. 366(20), is the Parliament. The only other Act to be referred to is the Railways (Local Authorities' Taxation) Act, 1941 (Act XXV of 194 1 ), which was an Act to regulate the extent to which railway property shall be liable to taxation imposed by an authority. Section 3(1) of that Act provided that a railway administration shall be liable to pay any tax in aid of the funds of any local authority, if the Central Government, by notification in the Official Gazette, declared it to be so liable. Section 4 provided for the Central Government, by notification in the Official Gazette, revoking or varying any notification issued under section 135(1) of the Railways Act. The learned Additional Solicitor-General, appearing for the appellant, pointed out that the expression 'railway' had not been defined in the United Provinces Municipalities Act, or in the Terminal Tax Rules. In the absence of any special definition contained in the provisions, granting the exemption, in question, the expression 'railway', occurring in item 2, of Schedule B, of the Terminal Tax Rules, must bear the commonly understood meaning of 'a carriage of passenger and goods, on iron rails'. By virtue of the definition, in section 311(2) of the 1935 Act, and the provision,corresponding to it, in the Constitution, viz., Art. 366(20), the appellant's system, though registered under the Tramways Act, was a railway. The mere fact that section 135, of the Railways Act, had not been applied to the appellant's system, is not a decisive factor against the appellant, as had been assumed by the High Court. In view of the various features of the appellant's system, and pointed out by us earlier, it is argued that the appellant's system is a 'railway', both in law and in fact. It satisfies all the ingredients of a railway and, if that is so, the appellants are entitled to the exemption provided for, under item 2 of Schedule B, of the Terminal Tax Rules. On the other hand, Mr. Garg, learned counsel appearing for the respondent Board, pressed before us for acceptance the various reasons, given by the High Court, for holding that the appellant is not entitled to claim be exemption. In particular, counsel pointed out that there were two different enactments, one dealing with 'tramways' and the other with 'railways', being the Tramways Act and the Railways Act, respectively. Therefore, there were two diff- erent systems, under two different names, namely 'tramways' and 'railways', which was clearly known to the authorities concerned at the time when the Terminal Tax Rules were framed, and so when the expression 'railway' was used in the exemption clause, it must have been the intention of the framers of the Rules to bring, within its ambit, only the 'railways' constructed under the Railways Act. The appellant's system, though called a 'railway' and though it might have ill the features of i railway, it is pointed out, nevertheless, that inasmuch is it has been constructed under a different enactment, viz., the Tramways Act, it cannot be treated as a 'railway' for the purposes of the exemption. Counsel also stressed that section 135 of the Railways Act had not been applied to the appellant. We are not impressed with the approach made by the learned Judges of the High Court, for negativing the claim for exemption, made by the appellant. It must be borne in mind that the expression 'railway has not been defined either in the concerned Municipalities Act, orthe Rules; if such is the case., the definition must hold the field. Going by the definition of the expression ' railway', containedin s. 311(2) of the Government of India Act, 1935, and the corresponding provision in article 366(20) of the Constitution, the appellant's system is a 'railway'. All the provisions of the Railways Act have been extended to the appellant, excepting section 135. In our opinion, if the appellant is a 'railway', otherwise, the mere fact that the provisions of section 135, of the Railways Act, have not been applied, is of no consequence.We have already referred to the fact, which is not in dispute, that the appellant's railway passes through four districts in U.P. andDelhi, and that it has got all the features of a railway, as ordinarily understood. In this connection, we may refer to certain English decisions, where the claim, made on behalf of a system, for being taxed at a concessional rate, had come up for consideration. In Blackpool and Fleetwood Tramroad Company v. Thornton Urban Council(1), the Court of Appeal had to consider as to how far the Blackpool & Fleetwood Tramroad Company, the appellant before them, was entitled to the assessment, at a lower rate under section 211 (1) (b), of the Public Health Act, 1875 (38 & 39 Viet. c. 55). The material portion of that section was : \"the occupier of any land . . . used only as a canal . . . or as a railway, constructed under the powers of any Act of Parliament, for public conveyance, shall be assessed in respect of the same in the proportion of one- fourth part only of the net annual value thereof.\" The question was as to whether the appellant, in that case, was a 'railway', to whom the said provision would apply. The appellant company had constructed and maintained a tramroad connecting two systems of tramways, under the local Acts of 1896 and 1898. Various provisions of the Railways Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, had been applied to the tramroad. The tramroad, in that case, was on rails laid on sleepers, fenced off from adjoining land, excepting at the level crossings of roads. The Divisional Court had rejected the claim of the appellant; but the Court of Appeal held that the tramroad was land 'used only as a railway constructed under the power of an Act of Parliament for public conveyance, within the meaning of section 21 1 (1)(b) of the Public Health Act, 1875, and that the company was, consequently, entitled to be assessed, in respect of the said 'railway', at onefourth of its net annual value. The appellants contended that the tramroad was and could only be worked as a railway and was, in fact and in law, used as a railway, and, in consequence, they urged that the tramroad, maintained by them, is 'land' used only as a railway. The Court of Appeal noted that the rails were raised and laid on sleepers, just as a railway is laid, and that was the main distinction between the appellant's system, and a tramway, which ran along public streets and in grooved rails. No doubt, it was pointed out for the Urban Council, that the appellant company had been incorporated under the Tramways Act and the very fact that certain provisions of the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act were applied to the appellant's system showed that the appellant was not a railway. The Court of Appeal held that it was impossible to distinguish the piece of tramroad, owned by the (1) L. R. [190711 K.B.D. 568. appellants, from a railway and that the exemption provided for in the Public Health Act applied to the tramroad of the appellants as it would, to any ordinary railroad passing through parts where it was not deriving the full benefit from the district rates in those parts. The Court of Appeal also rejected the contention of the Urban Council that the tramroad, owned by the appellants could be treated as a 'railway' only for particular purposes, and not for the purpose of claiming the exemption under the Public Health Act; because, according to the Court of Appeal, a reading of section 211 (1) (b) of the Public Health Act, showed that it applied to land used as a railway, i.e., constructed as a railway in fact. This decision was taken up in further appeal, before the House of Lords, whose decision is reported as Thornton Urban Council v. Blackpool and Fleetwood Tramroad Company(1), and the decision of the Court of Appeal was confirmed. In the course of the judgment, after referring to section 211 of the Public Health Act, Lord Macnaghten observed, at p. 267 : \"Now it cannot be denied that the rails on which the tramcars run, with the embankment or foundation on which they rest, and everything that supports them, do form a road or way, and that that road or way was constructed under parliamentary powers for public conveyance. Is it 'a railway'? There is nothing in the Public Health Act, 1875, or in the earlier Acts, in which the same provision is found, to confine the word ' railway' as used in those Acts to a particular kind of railway, or to limit the generality of the expression in any way.\" His Lordship, further observed at p. 268 : \"It seems to me that if it is a railway in fact, not differing from other railways in any material particular, it is nonetheless a railways because the promoters in their special Act chose to call it a 'tramroad'-a very convenient term to use for the title of their Act and the name under which they sought incorporation. Nor is it the less a railway because some only of the sections of the Railways Clauses Consolidation Act are incorporated in the special Act, or because, if one did not know what the thing really was, the language used for the purpose of applying the sections which are incorporated might seem to import that it was not, properly speaking, a railway at all. You must look at the special Act to see that it confers the appropriate powers of construction. Every- thing else in the Act is, I think, beside the question which this House has now to determine.\" (1) L.R. [1909] A.C. 264.In our opinion, the observations of the House of Lords, ex- tracted above, are apposite, to the case on hand. We have already pointed out that neither the Municipal Act, nor the Terminal Tax Rules give any special definition of the expression 'railway', and, so far as we could see, there is nothing in the said Act or the Rules to indicate that the word 'railway', in item 2 of Schedule B, is used only to refer to a 'railway' registered under the Railways Act or to limit the generality of the expression 'railway' in any way. Under those circumstances, if the appellant is a 'railway' in fact, as commonly understood-there does not appear to be any serious controversy on that point-it will be a 'rail- way', notwithstanding the fact that it is registered as a 'tramway', under the Tramways Act. The legislature itself has applied the various provisions of the Railways Act to the appellant, and the appellant also satisfies the definition of a 'railway' under the Government of India Act, 1935, and the Constitution. The provisions of the Indian Railway Companies Act, 1895, have also been applied to the tramways constructed, under the Tramways Act, by the Indian Tramway Act of 1902. The second preamble to the last mentioned Act, clearly shows that the tramways, to which the Indian Railway Companies, Act was made applicable, '#,lo not differ in structure and working from railways'. The object underlying the exemption under item 2, of Sche- dule B, to the Terminal Tax Rules, is also not far to seek. The railways pass through areas where it is not deriving the full benefit of all the amenities provided by the Municipal Boards. Therefore, in our opinion, the appellant satisfies the definition of a 'railway', so to be entitled to the exemption provided under item 2 of Schedule B. Before we close the discussion, we \",ill also refer to the decision of th- House of Lords in Tottenham Urban Council v. Metropolitan Electric Tramways, Ltd.(1). The same question regarding the eligibility of a 'tramway' for exemption, under section 21 1(1)(b) of the Public Health Act, 1 875, came up for consideration in that case. From the judgment, it will be seen that the company were working, as a connected system, a tramway and a light railway, which were constructed in and along certain public streets and roads, in the district of the urban Council.- The 'tramway' was constructed under the Tramway Acts and Orders and the 'railway,' under the Light Railways Act, 1896. Both were identical as to the mode of construction and materials used. The claim of the company in respect of the 'railway', as such, for assessment at a lower rate. was accepted; but, so far as the 'tramway' \",as concerned, the House of Lords held that it is not a 'railway', within the meaning of section 21 1(1)(b), of the Public Health Act, 1875. The (1) L. R. [1913]1 A. C. 702. reason given by the House of Lords, for not accepting the claim of the tramway, was that in the great bulk of public legislation, relating to railways, the legislation has universally been understood and interpreted by Courts as applying only to that which is popularly known as a 'railway', and not to that which is Popularly known as a 'tramway'. And special emphasis is laid by the House of Lords that the legislature has used the word 'railways' and not 'railways and tramways', in section 211 of the Public Health Act, 1875. We are only adverting to this decision to show that, on the basis of an interpretation placed by the Courts, the House of Lords held that the word 'railways', in the Public Health Act, 1875, will not take in 'tramways'. But, no such circumstances, as pointed out by the House of Lords, in the said decision, exist in the present case before us. On the other hand, the position is -exactly the opposite, as will be seen from the Government of India Act, 1935, and the Constitution. Even applying the popular test, adopted by the House of Lords, in this case, the appellant is undoubtedly a .railway'. In our opinion, the principles laid down by the House of Lords in Thornton Urban Council v. Blackpool and Fleetwood Tramroad Company(1), apply to the particular matter on hand and, we hold that the appellant, being a 'railway', is entitled to the exemption under item 2, of Schedule B, to the Terminal Tax Rules, in question. We, accordingly, allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of the High Court, and further direct that a writ will issue, as prayed for by the appellant. The appellant will be entitled to its costs, from the first respondent, both in this Court and in the High Court. G. C. Appeal allowed. (1) L. R. [1909] A.

From the Judgment and Order dated 3.1.1973 of the Allahabad High Court in Writ Petition number 4225 of 1971. S.C. Manchanda and A.K. Srivastava for the Appellants. NEMO for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATACHALIAH, J. This appeal by certificate, preferred by the State of U.P. against the Judgment, dated, 3.1.1973 of the Allahabad High Court in W.P. number 4225/1971, raises a short question whether the Rule 25-A(5) of the U.P. Sales Tax Rules 1948 (Rules) in so far as it stipulates that a 'recognition-certificate' issued for purposes of Section 4-B of the U.P. Sales Tax Act 1948 (Act) \"shall take effect from the date of its issue\" is inconsistent with does not carry-out the purposes of and, therefore, is ultra-vires Section 4-B of the U.P. Sales Tax Act 1948 (Act). The full bench of the Allahabad High Court, by a majority, has, by the judgment under appeal, preferred this view. 2. So far as the declaration on the law on the point is concerned, the matter loses much of its edge in view of the relevant amendment brought about by the U.P. Taxation Laws (Amendment & Validation) Act 1978, which now provides that such a recognition certificate shall take effect from the anterior date of the presentation of the application by the dealer. By the same amendment, the certificate is rendered valid, for three successive assessment years at a time and the renewals shall also be for like periods. 3. The necessary and material facts are in a short compass and may briefly be stated: Respondent Haji Ismail Noor Mohammad & Co. a registered firm of partners was a \"Dealer\" registered under the Act. It, inter-alia, carried on the business of manufacture of oils from groundnuts and other oil seeds. The oil so manufactured was sold by the Dealer both intra-state; inter-state and by way of export. Under Section 3-D of the Act, a dealer is liable to purchase-tax on oil seeds at 3% ad-valorem on the turnover of the purchases made by the dealer from the cultivators or other unregistered dealers. Section 4-B of the Act, however, contemplates special reliefs to certain manufactures of notified goods, the relief being in the form of concessional rate of purchase tax or exemption there from, as the case may be, as notified by the State-Government if the \"dealer holds a recognition-certificate issued under sub-section (2) in respect thereof.\" On 10.2.1969, the State Government notified that oils of all kinds to be \"notified goods\" for purposes of Section 4-B and that the purchases by the dealer, liable to tax on the turnover of the firstpurchases shall be entitled to a concessional rate of tax at 2% on theraw-material required for the manufacture of notified-goods. The present controversy relates to the Dealer's entitlement to the concessional rate of purchase tax respecting the purchase turn-over of its first-purchases under the said notification. 4. On 21.3.1969, Respondent applied under Section 4- B(2) to the prescribed-authority, in the prescribed-form for the grant of a recognition certificate. The recognition certificate, for certain reasons, was granted only on 5.2.1969. There appears no dispute that the turn-over of the first-purchases of the Respondent, respecting which the claim for reduced-rate of tax was made, constituted raw- material required for the manufacture of notified goods and, therefore, satisfied the requirement of the notification. However, the relief was confined to the turnover of such first-purchases made only after 5.12.1969, i.e., the date of issue of the certificate and the relief in respect of the turnover prior to that date was refused on the basis of the condition in sub-rule 5 of Rule 25-A which provided that \"such certificate shall take effect from the date of its issue\". Respondent, in its writ-petition before the High Court contended that this clause in Sub-Rule (5) of Rule 25-A is at cross-purposes with and did not carry out the objects of Section 4-B and is ultra-vires Section 4-B. The High Court, by majority opinion, has accepted this contention. 5. The provisions of Section 4-B and Rule 25A(5) may now be noticed: \"4-B. Special relief to certain manufacturers. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in sections 3, 3-A, 3-AA and 3-D:- (a) where any goods liable to tax under section 3-D are purchased by a dealer who is liable to tax on the turnover of his first purchases under that section and the dealer\" holds a recognition certificate issued under subsection (2) in respect thereof,\" he shall be liable in respect of those goods to tax at such concessional rate, or be exempt from tax, as may be notified in the Gazette by the State Government in that behalf; (b) where any goods liable to tax under any other section are sold by a dealer to another dealer and such other dealer furnishes to the selling dealer in the prescribed form and manner a certificate to the effect that he holds a recognition certificate issued under sub-section (2) in respect thereof, the selling dealer shall be liable in respect of these goods to tax at such concessional rates, or be exempt from tax as may be notified in the Gazette by the State Government in that behalf. (2) A dealer who requires any goods referred to in sub-section (1) for use as raw material for the purposes of manufacture in the State of Uttar Pradesh of any notified goods, and such notified goods are intended to be sold by him in the State or in the course of inter-state trade or commerce or in the course of export out of India, may apply within such period, and in such form and manner, as may be prescribed, to the assessing authority for the grant of recognition certificate in respect thereof and if the applicant satisfied such requirements and conditions as may be prescribed, the assessing authority shall grant to the dealer in respect of such goods a recognition certificate in such form and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed.\" Sub-Rule 5 of Rule 25-A provides: \"25-A(5). The recognition certificate shall ordinarily be issued within 30 days of the presentation of the application to the Sales Tax Officer. If, however, it may not be possible to issue the certificate within the time specified above, the Sales Tax Officer shall obtain the approval of the Assistant Commissioner (Executive) of his range for an extension of time, after stating the reasons for which it is not possible to issue the certificate in time. Such certificate shall take effect from the date of its issue.\" (underlining supplied) In reaching such conclusion on the point as it did the reasoning that commended itself to the High Court was this: \".... The efficacy of the recognition certificate under clause (a) aforesaid becomes material and relevant at the time of the quantification of the purchase tax, i.e., when the assessment order is being drawn up. It is in the assessment proceedings that the liability to pay tax at a concessional rate is fructified. A dealer would be entitled to the concessional rate if he holds a recognition certificate.........\" \"........ The language of clause (b) does not make it a condition precedent or a necessary obligation that the purchasing dealer must at the time of the purchase produce the recognition certificate. If the purchasing dealer, subsequent to the transaction of purchase, furnishes to the selling dealer the certificate that he holds a recognition certificate, the requirements of clause (b) are fully satisfied.\" The High Court also took into account that sub-Rule 5 of Rule 25-A while rightly recognising the need for the issue of the certificate with due despatch and within a time bound schedule, could not, consistently with the scheme and purpose of Section 4-B, provide that the certificate shall take effect only from the date of its issue. 6. Shri Manchanda, learned Senior Advocate appearing in support of the appeal, contended that the interpretation placed by the High Court runs in the teeth of the express statutory language which stipulates that \"the dealers holds a recognition certificate\" and the interpretation placed on it by the High Court, if accepted, would have the effect of adding something to the language of the section which is not in the Section. Learned Counsel said that the High Court had, by the judgment, virtually introduced a fiction that under certain circumstances where there had been a delay in issuing the certificate, the dealer must be deemed to have held the certificate. Shri Manchanda submitted that the clear intendment of the provision was that the dealer should hold the 'recognition-certificate' at the time of the purchases and that it would not be sufficient compliance with the statute if the dealer comes to hold it subsequently. He accordingly commended the view that found favour with the learned judge in the minority in the High Court. We did not have the benefit of the arguments from the side of the respondent, which has remained unrepresented. 7. It is really a matter of construction of the language of Section4-B; whether the dealer should hold a recognition certificate at the time the purchases were made or whether the requirements of the 'Section should be held to be satisfied if the dealer holds such a \"recognition certificate\" at the time of the assessment of the turnover in question. The High Court has held that the requirements of the Section are substantially complied with if the certificate is available to the dealer at the time the liability to tax of the turnover in question is sought to be determined, subject to the requirement that the turnover is after the date of the application filed by the dealer for issue of a certificate. According to the High Court, the date of actual issue of the certificate should not be held to be material and that the benefit for the concessional rate of tax should be available to the dealer if the dealer, at the time of the assessment, holds a recognition certificate \"in respect thereof'. According to the High Court the language of Section 4-B does support the extreme construction that the recognition certificate should be held at the time of the purchases themselves. 8. On a consideration of the matter we are persuaded to the view that the construction placed on the provision by the High Court is an eminently plausible one. There is nothing basically wrong in the approach of the High Court that the statutory language does not insist upon the contemporaneity of the holding of the certificate with the purchases and that it is sufficient if the dealer, subsequently, comes to hold certificate \"in respect thereof\". It seems possible to say that to insist upon a contemporaneity of the purchases and the certificate would also amount to qualifying the word 'holds' in the section by adding the words \"at the time of the purchases\". It is true, the words \"in respect thereof\" as Lord Greene M.R. said are \"colourless words\", See Trustees v. IRC, [1946] 174 LT 133 but in Section 4-B, they are in their reference to the certificate, sufficiently, though non- specifically wide enough to include a certificate obtained later but pertaining to the turnover in question. If this is the scheme of Section 4-B in that it does not exclude from its contemplation the efficacy and sufficiency, for its purpose of a certificate issued subsequently, then, the rule which compels only its prospective operation might, not unreasonably, be held to be inconsistent with and ultra- vires of Section 4-B. We find therefore nothing unreasonable in this construction of Section 4-B. Indeed by the 1978 Amendment, this position has been made clear in the rule itself which, after the amendment, expressly provides that the certificate will take effect from the date of the application made by the dealer and not merely from the date of the issue. 9. In this view of the matter, the judgment of the High Court does not call for interference. The appeal is dismissed. However, there will be no order as to the cost. R.S.S.

From the Judgment and Order dated the 20th February, 1980 of the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi in S.A.O. 149 of 1979. S.K. Mehta for the Appellant. Yogeshwar Prasad, Ravinder Bana and Mrs. Rani Chhabra for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by FAZAL ALI, J. This appeal by special leave is directed against a judgment dated February 20, 1980 of the Delhi High Court decreeing the landlord's suit for ejectment of the tenant. The facts giving rise to the present litigation are summarised in the judgments of the Rent Controller and the High Court and need not be repeated. Shorn of details, the position seems to be that Baldev Singh took the premises on rent on May 12, 1961 at a monthly rental of Rupees 95. At the time when the tenancy started, the tenant was living in the tenanted house with his father, mother, two sisters and a brother. The tenant himself was at that time a bachelor but seems to have married subsequently. One of his sisters was married in this very house. As it happened, in 1971 the tenant went to Canada followed by his wife and children. It is alleged that after having gone to Canada, the husband alongwith his wife took up some employment there. Admittedly. the tenant did not return to India after 1971. While leaving for Canada the tenant had left his mother and brother in the house who were regularly paying rent to the landlord. There is some controversy as to whether or not the mother and brother, who were left behind, were being supported by the tenant or were living on their own earnings or by the income of the property left by the tenant in India. Such a controversy however, is of no consequence in deciding the question of law which arises for consideration in this case. On September 27, 1972 the landlord filed an application for ejectment of the tenant on the ground of bona fide requirement and non-residence of the tenant under clauses (d) and (e) of sub-section (1) of section 14 of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act'). The fundamental plea taken by the landlord was that with the exit of the tenant from the house it became vacant and his mother and brother who were left behind could not be treated as members of the family. Hence, in the eye of law the tenanted premises must be deemed to have fallen vacant. The suit was resisted by the mother, brother and sister of the tenant who averred that even if the tenant alongwith his wife and children had shifted to Canada, the non- applicants were continuing to live in the tenanted premises and as they had been paying rent to the landlord regularly, who had been accepting the same, no question of the tenancy becoming vacant arose. Thus, the entire case hinges on the interpretation of the word 'family' as also clauses (d) and (e) of section 141(1) of the Act. So far as clause (e) is concerned, both the courts below found as a fact that the landlord was not able to prove his bona fide necessity. Therefore, as far as ground (e) is concerned, the same no longer survives in view of the findings of fact recorded by the courts below. The only question that remains to be considered is whether the landlord can bring his case for eviction within the ambit of clause (d) of section 14(1) which may be extracted thus: \"14 (1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other law or contract, no order or decree for the recovery of possession of any premises shall be made by any court or Controller in favour of the landlord against a tenant: Provided that the Controller may, on an application made to him in the prescribed manner, make an order for the recovery of possession of the premises on one or more of the following grounds only, namely: XX XX XX (d) that the premises were let for use as a residence and neither the tenant nor any member of his family has been residing therein for a period of six months immediately before the date of the filing of the application for the recovery of possession thereof; A close analysis of this provision would reveal that before the landlord can succeed, he must prove three essential ingredients- (1) that the premises were let out for use as a residence, (2) that the tenant after having taken the premises has ceased to reside, and (3) that apart from the tenant no member of his family also has been residing for a period of six months immediately before the date of the filing of the application for ejectment. It is manifest that unless the aforesaid conditions are satisfied the landlord cannot succeed in getting a decree for ejectment. In the instant case, while it is the admitted case of the parties that the tenant had shifted to Canada alongwith his wife and children, yet he had left his mother, brother and sister in the house, hence the second essential condition of clause (d) continues to apply with full force. The learned counsel for the appellant, however, submitted that the mother, brother and sister were undoubtedly living with the tenant and so long as they continued to reside in the tenanted premises, there could be no question of the premises falling vacant. To this, the counsel for the landlord countered that neither the mother, nor the brother nor the sister could in law be treated as members of the family of the tenant after he had himself shifted to a country outside India. Even though while he was living in Delhi, he was in Government service. Thus, it was argued that in the eye of law, the so-called family members would lose their status as members of the family of the tenant and would be pure trespassers or licensees or squatters. While the suit of the landlord was dismissed by the Rent Controller, the Rent Control Tribunal allowed the appeal and directed eviction of the family members of the tenant under clause (d) of section 14(1) of the Act. The family members of the tenant then went up in appeal to the High Court which also affirmed the findings of the Tribunal and upheld the order of eviction passed by it. The High Court was also of the view that after the exit of the main tenant from India to Canada, neither the mother, nor the brother, nor the sister could be legally termed as a member of the family of the tenant. We have heard counsel for the parties and given our anxious consideration to all aspects of the matter and we feel that the High Court has taken a palpably wrong view of the law in regard to the interpretation of the term 'member of the family' as used in clause (d) of section 14(1) of the Act. In coming to its decision, the High Court seems to have completely overlooked the dominant purpose and the main object of the Act which affords several intrinsic and extrinsic evidence to show that the non-applicants were undoubtedly members of the family residing in the house and the migration of the main tenant to Canada would make no difference. The word 'family' has been defined in various legal dictionaries and severalauthorities of various courts and no court has ever held that mother or a brother or a sister who is living with the older member of the family would not constitute a family of the said member. Surely, it cannot be said by any stretch of imagination that when the tenant was living with his own mother in the house and after he migrated to Canada, he had severed all his connections with his mother so that she became an absolute stranger to the family. Such an interpretation is against our national heritage and, as we shall show, could never have been contemplated by the Act which has manifested its intention by virtue of a later amendment. Coming now to (the definitions, we find that in Words and Phrases (permanent Edition-volume 16) at pp. 303-311 the word 'family' has been defined thus: \"The father, the mother, and the children ordinarily constitute a \"family\". \"The word \"family\" embraces more than a husband and wife and includes children.\" \"A \"family\" constitutes all who live in one house under one head.\" \"Father and mother of two illegitimate children, and children themselves, all living together under one roof, constituted a \"family.\" (pp. 303-304) \"The word \"family\" in statute authorizing use of income for support of ward and \"family\" is not restricted to those individuals to whom ward owes a legal duty of support, but is an expression of great flexibility and is liberally construed, and includes brothers and sisters in poor financial circumstances for whom the insane ward, if competent, would make provision.\" (p. 311) \"The general or ordinarily accepted meaning of the word \"family\", as used in Compensation Act, means a group, comprising immediate kindred, consisting of the parents and their children, whether actually living together or not.\" (p. 343) (Emphasis ours) Similarly, in Webster's Third New International Dictionary, the word 'family' is defined thus: \"Family-household including not only the servants but also the head of the household and all persons in it related to him by blood or marriage...a group of persons of common ancestry.\" (p. 821) (Emphasis supplied) In Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary (New Edition 1972), the word 'Family' has been defined thus: \"family-the household, or all those who live in one house (as parents, children, servants): parents and their children)\" In Concise Oxford Dictionary (Sixth Edition), the same definition appears to have been given of the word 'family' which may be extracted thus: \"family-Members of a household, parents, children, servants, etc. set of parents and children, or of relations, living together or not; persons children. All descendants of common ancestor.\" A conspectus of the connotation of the term 'family' which emerges from a reference to the aforesaid dictionaries clearly shows that the word 'family' has to be given not a restricted but a wider meaning so as to include not only the head of the family but all members or descendants from the common ancestors who are actually living with the same head. More particularly, in our country, blood relations do not evaporate merely because a member of the family-the father, the brother or the son-leaves his household and goes out for some time. Furthermore, in our opinion, the legislature has advisedly used the term that any member of the family residing therein for a period of six months immediately before the date of the filing of the action would be treated as a tenant. The stress is not so much on the actual presence of the tenant as on the fact that the members of the family actually live and reside in the tenanted premises. In fact, it seems to us that clause (d) of s. 14(1) of the Act is a special concession given to the landlord to obtain possession only where the tenanted premises havebeen completely vacated by the tenant if he ceased to exercise any control over the property either through himself or through his blood relations. In fact, a controversy arose as to what would happen to the members of the family of the tenant if while residing in the premises he dies and in order to resolve this anomaly the legislature immediately stepped in to amend certain provisions of the Act and defined the actual connotation of the term 'members of the family'. By virtue of Act 18 of 1976 the definition of \"Tenant\" was inserted so as to include various categories of persons. Sub-clause (iii) of clause (i) of section 2 of the Act actually mentions the persons who could be regarded as tenant even if main tenant dies. This sub-clause may be extracted thus: \"(1) \"tenant\" means any person by whom or on whose account or behalf the rent of any premises is, or, but for a special contract, would be, payable and includes- (i) a sub-tenant; (ii) any person continuing in possession after the termination of his tenancy; and (iii) in the event of the death of the person continuing in possession after the termination of his tenancy, subject to the order of succession and conditions specified, respectively, in Explanation I and Explanation II to this clause such of the aforesaid person's- (a) spouse, (b) son or daughter or, where there are both son and daughter, both of them, (c) parents, (d) daughter-in-law, being the widow of his predeceased son, as had been ordinarily living in the premises with such person as a member or members of his family up to the date of his death, but does not include, .....\" It would appear that parents were expressly included in sub-clause (iii). It has also been provided that apart from the heirsspecified in clauses (a) to (d) (extracted above), even those persons who had been ordinarily living in the premises with the tenant would be treated as members of the family. The statement of objects and reasons for this amendment may be extracted thus: \"There has been a persistent demand for amendments to the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 with a view to conferring a right of tenancy on certain heirs/successors of a deceased statutory tenant so that they may be protected from eviction by landlords and also for simplifying the procedure for eviction of tenants in case the landlord requires the premises bona fide for his personal occupation. Further, Government decided on the 9th September, 1975 that a person who owns his own house in his place of work should vacate the Government accommodation allotted to him before the 31st December, 1975. Government considered that in the circumstances, the Act required to be amended urgently.\" If this was the intention of the legislature then clause (d) of section 14(1) of the Act could not be interpreted in a manner so as to defeat the very object of the Act. It is well settled that a beneficial provision must be meaningfully construed so as to advance the object of the Act, and curing any lacuna or defect appearing in the same. There are abundant authorities to show that the term \"Family\" must always be liberally and broadly construed so as to include near relations of the head of the family. In Hira Lal & ORS v. Banarsi Dass(1) even the learned Judge who decided that case had observed at page 472 that the term \"members of the family\" on the facts and circumstances of the case should not be given a narrow construction. In Gobind Dass & ORS versus Kuldip Singh(2) a Division Bench of Delhi High Court consisting of H.R. Khanna, C.J. (as he then was) and Prakash Narain, J. while recognising the necessity of giving a wide interpretation to the word \"family\" observed as follows: \"I hold that in the section now under consideration the word \"family\" includes brothers and sisters of the deceased living with her at the time of her death. I think that that meaning is required by the ordinary acceptation of the word in this connection and that the legislature had used the word \"family\" to introduce a flexible and wide term.\" In Mrs. G. V. Shukla v. Shri Prabhu Ram Sukhram Dass Ojha(1) Mahajan, J. (as he then was) observed as follows: \"Therefore, it must be held that the word 'family' is capable of wider interpretation, but that interpretation must have relation to the existing facts and circumstances proved on the record in each case.\" Even as far back as 1930, Wright, J. in Price v. Gould & Ors (2) (a King's Bench decision) had clearly held that the word \"family\" included brothers and sisters and in this connection observed as follows: \"I find as a fact that the brothers and sisters were residing with the deceased at the time of her death..It has been laid down that the primary meaning of the word \"family\" is children, but that primary meaning is clearly susceptible of wider interpretation, because the cases decide that the exact scope of the word must depend on the context and the other provisions of the will or deed in view of the surrounding circumstances.\" ... ... .... \"Thus, in Snow v. Teed (1870, 23 L.T. Rep. 303; L. Rep. 9 Eq. 622) it was held that the word \"family\" could be extended beyond not merely children but even beyond the statutory next of kin.\" In view, however, of the very clear and plain language of clause (d) of section 14(1) of the Act itself, we do not want to burden this judgment by multiplying authorities. On a point of fact, we might mention that the Rent Controller had given a clear finding that the mother, younger brother (Davinder Kumar Bangia) and sister (Vijay Lakshmi) were undoubtedly residing in the disputed premises alongwith the main tenant and continued to reside there even on the date when the action for ejectment was brought. In these circumstances, we are satisfied that the view taken by the High Court is legally erroneous and cannot be supported. The landlord has miserably failed to prove the essential ingredients of clause (d) of section 14(1) of the Act so as to entitle him to evict the members of the family of the main tenant. We therefore, allow this appeal, set aside the judgment and order of the High Court and dismiss the plaintiff's action for ejectment and restore the judgment of the Rent Controller. In the peculiar circumstances of the case, there will be no order as to cost. H.L.C. Appeal allowed."}, "annotations": [{"result": [{"value": {"start": 0, "end": 29, "text": "CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION:", "labels": ["NONE"]}}, {"value": {"start": 30, "end": 63, "text": "Civil Appeal number 1533 of 1980.", "labels": ["NONE"]}}, {"value": {"start": 64, "end": 184, "text": "From the Judgment and Order dated the 20th February, 1980 of the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi in S.A.O. 149 of 1979.", "labels": ["NONE"]}}, {"value": {"start": 185, "end": 214, "text": "S.K.

Tarachand Brijmohan Lal, for the appellant. Hardayal Hardy, for respondent number 1. 1958. May 1. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS C. T.-This is a plaintiff's appeal against the judgment and decree passed on April 22, 1952, by a Division Bench of the Punjab High Court reversing the decree passed on July 1, 1947, by the First Class Subordinate Judge, Ambala in favour of the plaintiff and dismissing the plaintiff's Suit number 239 of 1946. The appeal has been preferred on the strength of a certificate granted by the ]Division Bench on December 19, 1952. The facts material for the purpose of this appeal may now be shortly stated: One Lala Beni Pershad died in the year 1910 leaving him surviving his widow Mst. Daropadi (defendant respondent number 2) and' two sons by her, namely, Gokul Chand (defendant respondent number 1) and Raghunath Das (plaintiff appellant) who was then a minor. Lala Beni Pershad left considerable moveable properties including many G. P. Notes and also various immoveable properties including agricul- tural land, gardens and houses. After his death the family continued to be joint until disputes and. differences arose between the two brothers in 1934. Eventually oil November 12, 1934, the two brothers executed an agreement referring their disputes relating to the partition of the family properties to the arbitration of Lala Ramji Das who was a common relation.It is alleged that the respondent Gokul Chand had disposed of part of the ()'F. P. Notes and that at the date of the reference to arbitration G. P. Notes of the value of Rupees 26,500 only were held by Gokul Chand, as the Karta of the family. On June 21, 1936, the arbitrator made an award which was signed by both the, brothers statedly ill token of their acceptance thereof. The award was registered on July 28, 1936. By that award the arbitrator divided the imoveable, properties and shops as therein mentioned. As regards the G. P. Notes the arbitrator directed and awarded that out of the G. P. Notes of the value of Rupees 26,500, which then stood in the name of Gokul Chand, G. P. Notes of the value of Rupees 13,300 should be entered into the names of Gokul Chand and Mst. Daropadi and the remaining Notes of the value of Rupees 13,200 should be endorsed in the names of Raghunatb Das and Mst. Daropadi and that till her death Mst. Daropadi should alone be entitled to the interest on the entire G. P. Notes of the value of Its. 26,500 and that after her death Gokul Chand would be the owner of the (\"X. P. Notes of the value of Rupees 13,300 and Raghunath Das of G. P. Notes of the value of Rupees 13,200. The arbitrator further directed Gokul Chand to pay to Raghunath Das a sum of Rupees 20,000 in four several instalments together with interest thereon as mentioned therein. On August 31, 1936, Gokul Chand applied to the District Judge, Ambala under paragraph 20, of Schedule 11 to the Code of Civil Procedure for filing the award. During the pendency of those Proceedings the two brothers entered into a compromise modifying certain terms of the award which are not material for the purpose of the present appeal. By an order made on November 18, 1936, the District Judge directed the award as modified by the compromise to be filed and passed a decree in accordance with the terms of the award thus modified. On November 15, 1939, Raghunath Das made an application to the court of the District judge for execution of the decree. The District Judge transferred the application to the court of the Subordinate Judgewho directed notice of that application to be issued to Gokul Chand. Gokul Chand filed objection to the execution mainly on the ground that the decree had been passed without jurisdiction in that the District Judge had no power to pass a decree for partition of agricultural lands. The Subordinate Judge on December 23, 1942, accepted Gokul Chand's plea and dismissed the execution application. On appeal by Raghunath Das to the High Court a learned Single Judge on April 5, 1944, accepted the appeal, but on Letters Patent Appeal filed by Gokul Chand the Division Bench on March 15, 1945, reversed the order of the Single Judge and restored the order of dismissal passed by the Subordinate Judge. Having failed to obtain the relief granted to him by the decree passed upon the award on the ground of defect of jurisdiction in the court which passed the decree and consequently for want of jurisdiction in the executing court, Raghunath Das, on August 21, 1945, instituted Suit number 80 of 1945 against Gokul Chand for the recovery of Rupees 7,310-11-3 being the balance with interest remaining due to him out of the said sum of Rupees 20,000, awarded in his favour. Gokul Chand raised a number of pleas but eventually all his pleas were negatived and the senior Subordinate Judge, Ambala, by his judgment pronounced on December 22, 1945, decreed the suit in favour of Raghunath Das. Gokul Chand did not file any appeal therefrom and consequently that decree became final and binding as between the parties thereto. On June 5, 1946, Raghunath Das filed in the court of the Senior Subordinate Judge, Ambala a suit being Suit number 239 of 1946 out of which the present appeal has arisen. In this suit Raghunath Das claimed that Gokul Chand be ordered to transfer G. P. Notes of the value of Rupees 13,200 out of the G. P. Notes of the value of Rupees 26,500 to Raghunath Das and Mst. Daropadi by means of endorsement or some other legal way, to get them entered into the Government registers and to make them over to Raghunath Das, the plaintiff. Particulars of the numbers, the year of issue, the face value and the interest payable on all the said G. P.Notes were set out in the prayer. There was an alternative prayer that Gokul Chand be ordered to pay Rupees 13,200 to the plaintiff. Gokul Chand filed his written statement taking a number of pleas in bar to the suit. Not less than 12 issues were raised, out of which only issues numbers 2 and 3 appear from the judgment of the Subordinate Judge to have been seriously pressed. Those two issues were as follows:-\" (2) Is the suit within time ? and (3) Is the suit barred by Order 2, Rule 2 of the Civil Procedure Code?\" The Subordinate Judge decided both the issues in favour of the plaintiff. He held that article 49 of the Indian Limitation Act had no application to the facts of this case and that there being no other specific Article applicable, the suit was governed by the residuary article 120. The learned Subordinate Judge also took the view that the period from November 15, 1939 to March 15, 1945, spent in the execution proceedings should be excluded under section 14 of the Indian Limitation Act in computing the period of limitation under article 120. The learned Subordinate Judge also held that the cause of action in the earlier suit for the recovery of the sum of Rupees 7,310-11-3 was not the same as the cause of action in the present suit and, therefore, the present suit was not barred under 0. 2, r. 2, of the Code of Civil Procedure. The learned Subordinate Judge accordingly decreed the suit in favour of Raghunath Das. Gokul Chand appealed to the High Court. The appeal came up for hearing before a Division Bench of the Punjab High Court. Only two points, were pressed in support of the appeal, namely, (1) whether the suit was barred by time and (2) whether the suit was barred under 0. 2, r. 2, of the Code of Civil Procedure. Learned counsel appearing for Gokul Chand urged that the suit was one for the recovery of \"-other specific moveable property \" that is to say specific moveable property other than those falling within Arta. 48, 48A and 48B of the Indian Limitation Act and was accordingly governed by article 49. Article 49. provides three years' period of limitation I04for a suit for \" other specific moveable property or for compensation for wrongful taking or injuring or wrongfully detaining the same \" and this period of three years begins to run from \" when the property is wrongfully taken or injured or when the detainer's possession becomes unlawful \". In the opinion of the High Court the suit was for the recovery of specific Government promissory notes and this, according to the High Court, was plain from the perusal of para. 18 of the plaint which set out the reliefs claimed by the plaintiff in the suit. The reference to the numbers, value and the year of issue of G. P. Notes and the rates of interest carried by them appeared to the High Court to be decisive on this point. The High Court held that the suit was governed by article 49 and that, as the plaintiff would be out of time even if the period between November 15, 1939, and March 15, 1945, was excluded, the High Court did not think it necessary to consider the question of the applicability of section 14 of the Indian Limitation Act. As its finding on the issue of limitation was sufficient to dispose of the suit, the High Court did not discuss the other issue founded on 0. 2, r. 2, of the Code of Civil Procedure but allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit as barred by limitation. We are unable to accept the decision of the High Court as correct. The High Court overlooked the fact that so far as the G. P. Notes were concerned the decree upon the award only declared the rights of the parties. Under the decree Raghunath Das was entitled to have G. P. Notes of the value of Rupees 13,200 endorsed in the names of himself and Mst. Daropadi out of the G. P. Notes of the value of Rupees 26,500. The award or the decree thereon did not actually divide the G. P. Notes by specifying which particular G. P. Notes were to be endorsed in the names of Gokul Chand and Mst. Daropadi or which of them were to be endorsed in the names of Raghunath Das and his mother. Until the G. P. Notes were actually divided, either by consent of parties or by the decree of the court, neither of the brothers could claim any particular piece of G. P. Notes as his separate property orask for delivery of any particular C. P. Notes in specie. Gokul Chand not being agreeable to come to an amicable division of the G. P. Notes, Raghunath Das had perforce to seek the assistance of the court and pray that the entire lot of C. P. Notes of the value of Rupees 26,500 be divided by or under the directions of the court into two lots and one lot making up the value of Rupees 13,200 be endorsed in favour of him (Raghunath Das) and his mother by or on behalf of Gokul Chand and then delivered to him, the plaintiff. He could not in his plaint claim that particular pieces of G. P. Notes making up the value of Rupees 13,200 be delivered to him in specie. This being the true position, as we conceive it, Raghunath Das's suit cannot possibly be regarded as a suit for a \" specific moveable property \". That expression is apt only to cover a suit wherein the plaintiff can allege that he is entitled to certain specific moveable property and/or of which he is presently entitled to possession in specie and which the defendant has wrongfully taken from him and/or is illegally withholding from him. That is not the position here. It should be remembered that the two brothers were entitled to the G. P. Notes of the value of Rupees 26,500 originally as joint coparceners and thereafter, when the decree upon the award had been passed, as tenants- in-common. Until actual partition by consent of the parties or by court Gokul Chand, who held the custody of the G. P. Notes, could not be said to have taken them wrongfully from Raghunath Das and his possession of them could not be said to be or to have become unlawful. These considerations clearly distinguish this case from the case of Gopal Chandra Bose v. Surendra Nath Dutt (1) on which the High Court relied because in that case the defendant had no right to or interest in the G. P. Notes in question and had no right to retain possession thereof. Therefore, to the present situation the terminus a quo specified in the third column of article 49 can have no application. It is now well established that a suit by an heir against other heirs to recover his share of the moveable estate of a deceased person is not one for (1) (1908) XII C. W. N. 1010specific moveable property wrongfully taken such as is contemplated by Art 49, but is governed by article 120. See Mohomed Riasat Ali v. Mussumat Hasin Banu (1). The only difference between the facts of that case and those of the present case is that here the rights of the parties had been declared by the decree upon the award but that circumstance does not appear to us to make any material difference in the application of the principle laid down by the Judicial Committee. The substance of the plaintiff's claims in both cases is for separating his share out of the estate and for allotment and delivery to him of his share so separated. In short such a suit is nothing but a suit for partition or division of the moveable properties held jointly or as tenants-in-common by the parties and there being no specific Article applicable to such a suit it must be governed by article 120. The period of limitation fixed by article 120 is six years from the date when the right to sue accrues. In order, therefore, to be within the period of limitation the plaintiff claims to exclude the period November 15, 1939, to March 15, 1945, spent in the execution proceedings. Section 14 (1) of the Indian Limitation Act runs as follows: \" 14 (1) In computing the period of limitation prescribed for any suit, the time during which the plaintiff has been prosecuting with, due diligence another civil proceeding, whether in a Court of first instance or in a Court of appeal, against the defendant, shall be excluded where the proceeding is founded upon the same cause of action and is prosecuted in good faith in a Court which, for defect of jurisdiction, or other cause of a like nature is unable to entertain it.\" The respondent contends that the above section has no application to the facts of his case. We do not think that such contention is well-founded. The execution proceedings initiated by Raghunath Das were certainly civil proceedings and there can be no doubt that he prosecuted such civil proceedings with due diligence and good faith, for lie was obviously (i) (1893) L. R. 20 I. A. 155.anxious to have his share of the G. P. Notes separately allocated to him. He lost in the execution court but went on appeal to the High Court where he succeeded before a Single Judge, but eventually he failed before the Division Bench which reversed the order the Single Judge had passed in his favour. Therefore, there can be no question of want of due diligence and good faith on the part of Raghunath Das. In the next place the section excludes the time spent both in a court of first instance and in a court of appeal. Therefore, other conditions being satisfied, the entire period mentioned above would be liable to be excluded. The only questions that remain are (1) whether the proceedings were founded upon the same cause of action and (2) whether he prosecuted the proceedings in good faith in a court which for defect of jurisdiction \",as unable to entertain it. The execution proceedings were founded upon his claim to enforce his rights declared under the decree upon the award. The cause of action in the present suit is also for enforcement of the same right, the only difference being that in the former proceedings Raghunath Das was seeking to enforce his rights in execution and in the present instance he is seeking to enforce the same rights in a regular suit. There is nothing new that he is asking for in the present suit. That he prosecuted the execution proceedings in the Subordinate Court as well as in the High Court in good faith cannot be denied, for the Single Judge of the High Court actually upheld his contention that the court had jurisdiction to entertain his application. The execution proceedings failed before the Division Bench on no other ground than that the executing court had no jurisdiction to entertain the application, because the decree sought to be executed was a nullity having been passed by a court which had no jurisdiction to pass it. Therefore, the defect of jurisdiction in the court that passed the decree became, as it were, attached to the decree itself and the executing court could not entertain the execution proceeding on account of the same defect. The defect of jurisdiction in the executing court was finally determined whenthe Division Bench reversed the decision of the Single Judge who had entertained the execution proceeding. In our opinion Raghunath Das is entitled to the benefit of section 14 (1) of the Indian Limitation Act and the period here in before mentioned being excluded, there can be no doubt that the suit was filed well within the prescribed period of limitation and the judgment of the Division Bench cannot be sustained. In the view it took on the question of limitation the Division Bench did not consider it necessary to go into or give any decision on the other issue, namely, as to whether the suit was barred by 0. 2, r. 2. The suit should, therefore, go back to the High Court for determination of that issue. The result, therefore, is that we accept the appeal, set aside the judgment and decree of the High Court and remand the case back to the High Court for a decision on issue number 3 only. The appellant will get the costs of this appeal as well as the costs of the hearing in the High Court resulting in the decree under appeal and the general costs of the appeal and the costs of further hearing on remand will be dealt with by the High Court.

Appeal by Special Leave from the Judgment and Decree dated 20-2-76 of the Orissa High Court in M.A. 75/75. K. Sawhney and M. K. Garg for the Appellant G. B. Pai, Miss Uma Mehta and R. K. Mehta for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAILASAM, J.-This appeal is preferred by the Orissa Mining Corporation Ltd., (a Government of Orissa undertaking) by specialleave against the judgment and decree dated February 20, 1976 of the High Court of Orissa whereby the High Court upheld the judgment of the Subordinate Judge, Rourkela refusing to set aside the award of the arbitrator directing payment of certain moneys to the respondent herein. The respondent is a partnership firm carrying on business of transport, mining loading and unloading etc. with its office at Rourkela. The appellant called for a tender for the work of raising of iron ore in Khandadhar Mines and transporting it to Barsuan Railway siding, including wagon loading. An agreement was entered into between the, appellant and the respondent for a period of one year with effect from May 25, 1971. The estimated value of the contract was Rupees 6.77,040. The respondent under the terms of the contract was required to work in quarry numbers 1 and 2 in Khandadhar Mines but during the progress of the work, on the directions of the appellant, the respondent worked in quarry number 5 also which was at a distance of about 2 K.M. from quarry numbers 1 and 2. As the respondent had to cover an extra distance between quarry numbers 1 & 2 and quarry No 5 he demanded extra cost for the transport. The respondent also demanded cost for construction of a road at the schedule rate provided by the State P.W.D., Orissa, and submitted two bills, Bill number 1 dated March 31, 1972 and Bill No,. 2 dated May 1, 1972 for Rupees 62,477.50 and Rs, 6,104.60 respectively amounting to Rupees 68,582.00 in all for the extra load in transporting. A claim was also made towards the cost of constructing a road from quarry number 5 for Rupees 25,000. As in spite of repeated reminders the appellant did not pay for the bills the respondent called upon the appellant to refer the disputes for arbitration according to the contract. The respondent filed an application under section 20 of the Arbitration Act for a direction to the appellant to file the agreement in court and for the appointment of a Superintending Engineer of the State P.W.D. as the sole arbitrator and a reference to him to give his award on the dispute. The respondent, for the purpose of Court fee and jurisdiction, valued the suit at Rupees 93,582, The Subordinate Judge, Rourkela, after notice to the appellant and after hearing the parties ordered \"that the said agreement be filed, and it is further ordered that the following matters in difference specified in the said agreement number 4/F2 of 1971 arising in this suit namely for demand of payment of Rupees 93,582.00 on account of raising iron ore from quarry number 1 and 2 at Khandadhar Mine and transporting the same, to the Barsuan Railway siding including loading of wagons and also for the same work as per the subsequent order in respect of quarry number 5 which was at a distance of 2 kilometers away from quarry number 1 and 2 and for extra charges for this extra load of transporting and for construction of a road from quarry numbers 1 and 2 to the, quarry number 5 be referred for determination...... of the Arbitrator.\" The arbitrator on receipt of the order of reference issued notice to the parties calling upon them to file their respective statements and the documents on which they intended to rely on and to produce witnesses. The parties filed their respective statements and the arbitrator took up the hearing of the dispute. The respondent in these proceedings made a claim of Rupees 68,582 under the head \"4. Extra as the distance came to 14 Km. after verification from the same quantity mentioned in the Bill number 1 and 11.\" The arbitrator inspected the site and measured the distances. Regarding the claimof Rupees 25,000 for construction of the road the arbitrator found that the respondent is not entitled to it and rejected the claim. Regarding the claim for transport of the iron ore for the extra distance from quarry number 5, the respondent made an additionalclaim for Rupees 68,582 apart from the claim which he made in the plaintunder Bill numbers 1 and 11 for Rupees 68,582 on the ground that the extra distance came to 1.4 Kms. after verification. The arbitrator found the actual distance between quarry number 1 and 2 and quarry number 5 approximately 1.70 Kms. and allowed a sum of Rupees 1,16,570 under this head. He also directed the appellant to release the security deposits and earnest money amounting to Rupees 32,954.48 and pay the respondent on or before August 31, 1974. The award also provided that the appellant shall pay interest to the respondent at the rate of six per cent per annum on the amount of award and on the amount of security and earnest money from the date of the passing of the award i.e. May 31, 1974. Aggrieved at this award the appellant filed an application before the Subordinate Judge, Rourkela, the court that had made the reference to arbitration, for setting aside the award or in the alternative for remitting the award for further consideration various contentions were raised in the application. It is material for this appeal to ,refer only to the main ground of attack on the award, namely that the arbitrator had traversed beyond the reference made by the court by its order of reference in that though the claim was only for Rupees 93,582 inclusive of the claim for road construction for Rupees 25,000 which was negatived by the arbitrator, he acted without jurisdiction in allowing any claim overRs. 68,582.It was also contended that the arbitrator was in errorin directing the return of the security deposits and earnest money. The Subordinate Judge, Rourkela, by his order dated February 11, 1975, found that there was no error apparent on the face of the record which may make the, award unsustainable. It also found that the arbitrator did not exceed his jurisdiction and decreed the suit as per the terms of the award., Dissatisfied with the order of the Subordinate Judge the appellant, Orissa Mining Corporation Ltd., took up the matter in appeal to the High Court of Orissa. The High Court confirmed the order of the Subordinate Judge holding that the order of reference made by the court to the arbitrator Was not only in respect of the respondent's claim for Rupees 93.582 on account of raising of iron ore from quarry numbers 1 and 2 and transporting the same to Barsuan rialway station but also for the same work as per the subsequent order in respect of quarry number 5 which was at a distance of 2 kilometres away from quarry numbers 1 and 2. The main contention that was raised before the High Court was that the reference to the arbitrator being for determining the correctness of the respondent's claim of Rupees 93,582, 8-- 768SCI/77 only the arbitrator went beyond his jurisdiction and authority by giving an award for Rupees 1,16,570 towards transportation charges in favour of the respondent. The direction as to the refund of the security deposits and earnest money was also challenged. The High Court held that \"In the order of reference Rupees 93,582 has been referred to as a dispute on account of raising iron ores from quarry numbers 1 and 2 and transporting the same to Barsuan railway siding. The dispute relating to extra claim on account of raising and transporting iron ores as per the, subsequent order from quarry number 5 has also been specifically referred to the arbitrator as it appears from the order of reference. The correctness of the reference order not having been challenged the same is not open to question.\" It further held that \"it is futile, to argue that the reference made to the arbitrator was only confined to the respondent's claim of Rupees 93,582 and that the arbitrator in awarding Rupees 1,16,570 exceeded his authority and jurisdiction.\" We feel that the High Court has misconstrued the claim. There was no dispute in regard to raising of iron ore from quarry numbers 1 and 2 and transporting it to the railway siding. The whole dispute was regarding the claim for transporting the iron ore for the extra distance from quarry number 5. Paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of the plaint make this position clear. Paragraph 5 states that while the respondent was executing the work in quarry numbers 1 and 2 he was ordered to work in quarry number 5 which was at a distance of about 2 Kms from quarry numbers 1 and 2. According to paragraph 6 the respondent demanded extra cost for the transport from the said quarry as the distance increased. Paragraph 7 states that accordingly the, respondent submitted bill number 1 dated March 31, 1972 and bill number 2 dated May 1, 1972 making a total claim of Rupees 68,582. The point of attack on the award was therefore missed by the. High Court. it was that while the total claim under the plaint regarding the transport of extra distance was confined to Rupees 68,582 and the reference to the arbitrator was also for the same amount, the arbitrator acted beyond the scope of the arbitration in taking into account the claim which was put forward by the respondent for an extra sum of Rupees 68,582. It was sought to be contended by Mr. Pai, the learned counsel for the, respondent, that though the plaint claim was confined to Rupees 68,582 the order of reference is wider in scope and included other claims beyond the claim for Rupees 93,582. The order of reference is rather vague and not clear and is in the following terms : \" and it is further ordered that the following matters in difference specified in the said agreement number 4/F2 of 1971 arising in this suit namely for demand of payment of Rupees 93,582 on account of raising iron ore from quarry numbers 1 and 2 at Khandadhar Mine and transporting the same to the Barsuan Railway siding including loading of wagons and also for the same work as per the subsequent order in respect of quarry number 5 which was at a distance of 2 K.M. away from quarry numbers 1 and 2 and for extra charges for this extra load of transporting.......\" The order of reference appears to have been an attempt by the court to put all the reliefs claimed for in the plaint in one sentence. As admittedly there was no claim for transport of the iron ore between quarry numbers 1 and 2 and the railway siding, the only claim was for the transport of the iron ore for the extra distance. The view of the High Court was therefore on a misunderstanding of the relief prayed for by the respondent in the plaint. Mr. Pai while admitting that the reference to: arbitration was only as regards the transport of the iorn ore for the extra distance submitted that the claim was not confined to Rupees 93,582 only but should be understood as a claim for the extra transport which may amount to more than Rupees 93,582. We refrain from going into the merits of the claim for not only the extent of the extra distance covered is in dispute but also the charges for transport for a kilometer. The plea of the respondent in that while he, submitted Bill numbers 1 and 2 and claimed Rupees 68,582, the Bills were on the basis that the extra distance was only 1 K.M. but actually the distance was 2 Kms. and therefore he claimed twice the amount. The respondent submitted that the distance should be construed as 2 Kms. though it was found to be 1.4 Kms. On behalf ,of the appellant it was submitted that this plea should not be entertained as, the original Bills were on the basis of 2 Kms. and as the distance has been proved to be shorter he would not be entitled even to the claim made, in the plaint. The contentions on the merits need not be gone into. On a reading of the plaint, we are, satisfied that the claim for transporting the iron ore for the extra distance is limited to Rupees 68,582 ,and the whole claim after including the claim for construction of the road is confined only to Rupees 93,582. The arbitrator having disallowed Rupees 25,000 being the claim for construction of the road should have confined his award only to. Rupees 68,582. The claim of additional Rupees 68,582 before the arbitrator was clearly beyond the order of reference which incorporated the reliefs prayed for in the plaint by the respondent herein. It would have been different if the entire claim relating to the transport of the iron ore for the extra distance was made without specifying the amount of claim. When the amount has been. specified in the plaint and when the reference is confined to the claim made in the plaint, the arbitrator would have to restrict his award only to the claim. We are satisfied that in this case the arbitrator has exceeded his jurisdiction in embarking on the claim that was the first time put forward before him by the respondent. There is therefore an error ,apparent on the face of the award. Section 20(1) of the Arbitration Act, 10 of 1940, provides that where a difference has arisen and where any person have entered into an arbitration agreement they may apply to the court having jurisdiction in the matter to which the agreement relates, that the agreement be filed in court. Sub-section (4) to section 20 provides that the court shall order the agreement to be filed, and shall make an order of reference to the arbitrator appointed by the parties. When an agreement is filed in court and order of reference is made then the claim as a result of the order of reference is limited to a particular relief and the arbitrator cannot enlarge the scope of the reference and entertain freshclaims without a further order of reference from the court. On a construction of section 20 of the Arbitration Act the plea on behalf of the appellant will have to be accepted. In the circumstances of the case we do not think that the award should be set aside,' as the learned counsel for the appellant has also no objection in accepting the award in so far as it relates to Rupees 68,582. We feel that the award to the extent of Rupees 68,582 and interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the date of the award be confirmed. Regarding the direction as to return of security deposits and earnest money, as it is not the case of the appellant that the respondent is not entitled to the amount, we do not feel called upon to interfere with the order directing the appellant to pay the, amount to the respondent with interest at 6% per annum from the date of the award i.e. May 31, 1974. The parties will bear their own costs. P.B.R.

Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated April 18, 1966 of the Allahabad High Court in Criminal Appeal number 1642 of 1964. R.K. Garg, S.C.Agarwal, Sumitra Chakravarty and Uma Dutt, for the appellant. O.P. Rana, for respondent number 2. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Hegde J. Two contentions advanced in this appeal by special leave are (1) that the appeal filed by the Municipal Board, Saharanpur before the High Court of Allahabad under section 417(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code was not maintainable in law and (2) the accused could not have been convicted on the strength of the certificate of the Public Analyst annexed to the complaint. The High Court rejected both these contentions. The material facts relating to this appeal are these: The accused in this case is proprietor of Khalsa Tea Stall situated in Court Road, Saharanpur. Among other things, he was selling coloured sweets. On suspicion that the sweets sold by him were adulterated, the Food Inspector, Municipal Board, Saharanpur purchased from the accused for examination some coloured sweets under a Yaddasht on May 31, 1963 and sent a portion if the same to the Public Analyst of the Government of U.P. for examination. The Public Analyst submitted his report on June 24, 1963. It reads: \"See Rule 7 ( 3 ) REPORT BY THE PUBLIC ANALYST Report number 11652. I hereby certify that I, Dr. R.S. Srivastava, Public Analyst for Uttar Pradesh, duly appointed under the provisions of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954, received on the 4th day of June 1963 from theFood Inspector c/o Medical Officer of Health, Municipal Board, Saharanpur, a sample of coloured sweet (Patisa) prepared in Vanaspati number 264 for analysis, properly sealed and fastened and that I found the seal intact and unbroken. I further certify that I have caused to be analysed the aforementioned sample, and declare the result of the analysis to be as follows: Test for the presence of coal-tar dye :--Positive. Coal-tar dye identified :-- Metanil yellow. (colour Index number 138) ANALYTICAL DATA IN RESPECT OF FAT OR OIL USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE SAMPLE. 1. Butyro-refractometer reading at 40 dgree C :-- 50.5. 2. Melting point :-- 33.80C. 3. Baudouin's test for the presence of Til oil :Positive. 4. Tintometer reading on Lovibond Scale 4.0 Red Units plus 0.1 yellow unit coloured with a coal-tar dye namely, Metanil Yellow (Colour Index number 138) which is not one of the coal- tar dyes permitted for use in foodstuffs under rule number 28 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Rules, 1955. No chance had taken place in the constitutents of the sample which would have interfered with analysis. Signed this 24th day of June 1963. The sample belongs to :-- S. DHIAN SINGH S/O JIWAN SINGH R.S. Srivastava M.Sc., LL.B. Ph.D. (Lond.) P.R.L.C. Public Analyst to Govt. of U.P. Sendor's address: Public Analyst, Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow The Food Inspector, c/o. Medical Officer of Health, Municipal Board, Saharanpur.\" On the basis of that certificate, a complaint was filed in the court of City Magistrate, Saharanpur under section 7 read with section 16 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954. It is purported to have been filed by the Municipal Board, Saharanpur but it was signed by its Food Inspector. The accused pleaded not guilty. Various contentions were taken by the accused in support of his defence. The trial court acquitted him taking the view that as the report of the analyst did not contain any data, no conviction could be rounded on its basis and as the Yaddasht relating to the sale had not been attested as required by law, the seizure in question must be held to be invalid. As against that decision, the Municipal Board of Saharanpur went up in appeal to the High Court under section 417(3), Criminal . P.C. the High Court allowed the appeal disagreeing with the trial court on both the questions of law referred to earlier. It came to the conclusion that the analyst had given the necessary data hence his report afforded sufficient basis for conviction. It further opined that the fact that the Yaddasht had not been attested by the witnesses of the locality, did not vitiate the seizure made. At the hearing of the appeal, no objection about the maintainability of the appeal was taken. The judgment of the High Court was rendered on April 18, 1966. The High Court convicted the appellant and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two months. and to pay a fine of Rupees 100, in default to undergo further imprisonment for a period of one, month. On April 28, 1966, the accused field an application for certificate under article 134 of the Constitution. On May 4, 1966, when the application filed under article 134 of the Constitution for certificate was still pending, the accused moved the High Court under section 561 (A), Criminal . P.C. for reviewing its judgment dated April 18, 1966 principally on the ground that the appeal filed by the Municipal Board was not maintainable under section 417(3), Criminal . P.C. as the complaint had been instituted by the' Food Inspector and number t by the Municipal Board. The application under section 561(A) was dismissed by the High Court as per its order of March 16, 1967 repelling the contention of the accused that the complaint had not been instituted by the Municipal Board. It further came to the conclusion that it had no power to review its own judgment. The certificate prayed for under article 134 of the Constitution was also refused by a separate order of the same date. Thereafter this appeal was brought after obtaining special leave. Mr. Garg, learned Counsel for the appellant strenuously contended that the appeal filed by the Municipal Board of Saharanpur before the High Court under section 417(3), Criminal . P.C. was not maintainable as the complaint from which that appeal had arisen had been instituted by the Food Inspector. Section 417(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that if an order of acquittalis passed in any case instituted upon complaint, the High Court may grant to the complainant special leave to appeal against the order of acquittal. It is clear from that section that special leave under that provision can only be granted to the complainant and to no one else. It may be noted that in this case no appeal against acquittal had been filed by the State. Hence the essential question for consideration is whether the complainant before the Magistrate was the Municipal Board of Saharanpur ? The complainant shown in the complaint is the Municipal Board of Saharanpur but the complaint was signed by the Food Inspector. Section 20 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 prescribes that no prosecution for an offence under that Act should be instituted except by, or with the written consent of, the Central Government or the State Government or a local authority or a person authorised in this behalf, by general or special order, by the Central Government or the State Government or a local authority. There is no dispute that the Municipal Board is a local authority. Hence it was competent to file a complaint.It was also competent for that board to authorise someone else to file complaints under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act on its behalf. As seen earlier, the complaint purports to have been filed by the Municipal Board. That Board could have authorised its Food Inspector to file the complaint on its behalf. Neither in the trial court, nor in the High Court at the stage of hearing of the appeal, any objection was taken by the accused as to the maintainability either of the complaint or of the appeal. Both those courts and the parties before it proceeded on the basis that the Municipal Board, Saharanpur was the complainant and its Food Inspector had filed the complaint on its behalf. It is only after the disposal of the appeal, the accused for the first time took up the contention that the Municipal Board was not the real complainant. It is true that the complaint was signed by the Food Inspector. As seen earlier it was competent for the Municipal Board to authorise him to file the Complaint. The question whether he was authorised by the Municipal Board to file the complaint was never put into issue. Both the parties to the complaint proceeded on the basis that it was a validly instituted complaint. If the Municipal Board had not authorised him to file the complaint then the complaint itself was not maintainable. If that is so, no question of the invalidity of the appeal arises for consideration. It was never the case of the accused that the complaint was invalid. In K.C. Aggarwal v. Delhi Administration(1), this Court has held that a complaint filed by one of the officers of a local authority', at the instance of that authority is in law a complaint institut- (1) Criminal Appeal number 100 of 1966 decided on 27th May, 1969;ed by that local authority. Therefore if the Complaint with which we are concerned in this case had been filed by the Food Inspector on the authority of local board, the complaint must be held to have been instituted by the local board itself. The question whether the Food Inspector had authority to file the complaint on behalf of the local board is a question of fact. Official acts must be deemed to have been done according to law. If the accused had challenged the authority of the Food Inspector to file the complaint, the trial court would have gone into that question. The accused cannot be permitted to take up that contention for the first time after the disposal of the appeal. This Court refused to entertain for the first time an objection as regards the validity of a sanction granted in Mangaldas Raghavji and ANR v. State of Maharashtra and ANR (1) Mr. Garg, learned Counsel for the accused urged that a permission under section 20 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 to file a complaint is a condition precedent for validly instituting a complaint under the provisions of that Act. The fulfilment of that condition must be satisfactorily proved by the complainant before a court can entertain the complaint. Without such a proof, the court will have no jurisdiction to try the case. In support of that contention of his he sought to take assistance from the decision of the Judicial Committee in Gokulchand Dwarkadas Morarka v. The King(2) and Madan Mohan Singh v. The State of U.P.(3). Both those decisions deal with the question of the validity of sanctions given for the institution of certain criminal proceedings. The provisions under which sanction was sought in those cases required the sanctioning authority to apply its mind and find out whether there was any justification for instituting the prosecutions. The Judicial Committee as well as this Court has laid down that in such cases, the court must be satisfied either from the order of sanction or from the other evidence that all the relevant facts had been placed before the sanctioning authority and that authority had granted the sanction after applying its mind to those facts. The ratio of those decisions has no bearing on the facts of this case. Under section 20 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954, no question of applying one's mind to the facts of the case before the institution of the complaint arises as the authority to be conferred under that provision can be conferred long before a particular offence has taken place. It is a conferment of an authority to institute a particular case or even a class of cases. That -section merely prescribes that persons or authorities designated in that section are alone competent to file complaints under the statute in question. (1) [1965] 2 S.C.R. 894. (2) 75 I.A.p. 30. (3) A.I.R. 1954 S.C. 736. For the reasons mentioned above, we are unable to accept the contention of the accused that the Municipal Board of Saharanpur was not competent to file the appeal. The only other question canvassed before us is that the report of the analyst could not have afforded a valid basis for rounding the conviction as the data on the basis of which the analyst had reached his conclusion is not found in that report or otherwise made available to the court. We are unable to accept this contention 'as well. It is not correct to. say that the report does not contain the data on the basis of which the analyst came to his conclusion. The relevant data is given in the report. A report somewhat similar to the one before us was held by this Court to contain sufficient data in Mangaldas's(1) case referred to earlier. The correct view of the law on the subject is as stated in the decision of the Allahabad High Court in Nagar Mahapalika of Kanpur v. Sri Ram(2) wherein it is observed: \"that the report of the public analyst under section 13 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 need not contain the mode or particulars of analysis nor the test applied but should contain the result of analysis namely, data from which it can be inferred whether the article of food was or was not adulterated as defined in section 2 (1 ) of the Act.\" In the result the appeal fails and the same is dismissed. The appellant is on bail. He should surrender to his bail and serve the sentence imposed on him. Y.P. Appeal dismissed. (1) [1965] 2 S.C.R. 894. (2) [1963] All.

Appeal by Special Leave from the Judgment and Decree dated the 3rd October, 1964 of the High Court of Judicature at Patna in Appeal from Original Decree number 152 of 1959. P.K. Chatterjee and Rathin Das for the Appellant. S.V. Gupte and B.P. Singh for Respondents 1-2. Santok Singh for Respondents 3-4. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRACHUD, J.-One Trilok Prasad Singh, who was the last male holder in his line, died on May 12, 1948 leaving behind his widow Kachnar Kuer and his step-mother Sheo Kuer. On February 12, 1956 Kachnar Kuer executed two registered deeds. By one of these she adopted a son to her deceased husband and by the other, which is described as a Deed of Arpan-nama, she created a religious endowment in the name of Sri Gopalji and appointed her mother-in-law Sheo Kuer as a shebait. Respondents 1 and 2, claiming to be reversioners, filed suit number 16 of 1956 in the court of the First Subordinate Judge, Gaya, for a declaration that the two deeds were void and illegal and were not binding on their reversionary interest. Kachnar Kuer was defendant 1, the adopted son was defendant 2 and Sheo Kuer was defendant 3 to the suit. During the suit, the defendants were evidently of one mind and they contended by their written statements that the impugned deeds were executed under the authority given by the deceased Trilok Prasad Singh and that respondents 1 and 2 had no right to bring the suit after June 17, 1956 when the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 came into force The trial court dismissed the suit holding that Trilok Prasad Singh had given authority to Kachnar Kuer to make an adoption and to create an endowment and therefore both the deeds were valid. Against the dismissal of their suit, respondents 1 and 2 filed First Appeal number 152 of 1959 in the High Court of Patna. By its judgment dated October 3, 1964 the High Court allowed the appeal and decreed the suit holding that Trilok Prasad Singh had not given authority to Kachnar Kuer to take a son in adoption and under the Banaras School of Hindu Law by which the parties were governed, an adoption made by a widow without the authority of her husband was invalid. The High Court also held that Trilok Singh had not authorised Kachnar Kuer to create a religious endowment over any part of his property and since by the Arpan-nama a large piece of property was dedicated to the deity the dedication was void. On the question whether, after the coming into force of the Hindu Succession Act, respondents 1 and 2 as reversioners could maintain the suit, the High Court held that on the material date Kachnar Kuer was not in possession of the property and therefore her limited estate could not ripen into an absolute estate under the Hindu Succession Act. Kachnar Kuer made an application to the High Court for a certificate of fitness to appeal to this Court and the High Court by its order dated May 10, 1965 granted a certificate of fitness under Article 133(1) (b) of the Constitution. But after the petition of appeal was lodged in this Court, Kachnar Kuer joined hands with respondents 1 and 2 and purported to enter into a compromise dividing theproperty left by Trilok Prasad Singh between themselves. The appellant, Sheo Kuer, who was appointed as a shebait under the deed of Arpan-nama has thereafter, obtained special leave to appeal to this Court from the judgment of the High Court. We are, in this judgment, concerned with Sheo Kuer's appeal, not with the appeal filed by Kachnar Kuer by certificate. The High Court has rejected the evidence led to show that 'Trilok Prasad Singh had given authority to Kachnar Kuer to make an adoption to him. The finding that the adoption is without the authority of the husband and therefore void is not challenged before us either by Kachnar Kuer or by the adopted son and that finding must there. fore be confirmed. Since the evidence on the other question as to whether Trilok Prasad Singh had given authority to Kachnar Kuer to create a religious endowment was closely linked with the question regarding the authority to adopt and since the pattern of evidence on both the questions is identical, the High Court held that Kachnar Kuer did not either have the authority of her husband to instal the deity or dedicate any 1 property to the deity. This finding is not challenged before us by Sheo Kuer, the shebait appointed under the Arpan-nama, and therefore we must proceed on the basis that the dedication was created by Kachnar Kuer without the authority of her husband. The point involved for determination in the appeal thus relates to the powers of a Hindu female on whom property has devolved upon the death of her husband, to alienate the property for religious purposes. This question has been the subject matter of several decisions Of the Indian High Courts as also of the Judicial Committee. These decisions, beginning with one of the earliest pronouncements on the subject in Collector of Masulipatam v. Cavly Vencata, upto the decision of this Court in Kamala Devi v. Bachu Lal Gupta have been discussed with fullness and clarity of Mr. Justice Bijan Kumar Mukherjea in his Tagore Law Lectures on the Hindu Law of Religious and Charitable Trust. It is unnecessary to analyse the various Decisions which the learned author has considered because the true position on the subject is crystalised in the decision in Kamala Devi's case. The law must now be taken as well-settled that a Hindu widow possessing a widow's estate cannot alienate the property which has devolved on her except for special purposes. To support an alienation for purely worldly purposes she must show necessity but she has a larger power of disposition for religious and charitable purposes or for Those purposes which are supposed to conduce to the spiritual` welfare of her husband. As pointed out by the Privy Council in Sardar Singh v. Kuni Behari, the Hindu system recognises two sets of religious acts: those which are considered as essential for the salvation of the soul of the deceased and others which, though not essential or obligatory, are still pious observances which conduce to the bliss of the . deceased's soul. The powers of a Hindu female to alienate property are wider in respect of acts which conduce to the spiritual benefit ofher deceased husband. The widow is entitled to sell the property, even the whole of it, the income of the property is not sufficient to cover the expenses for such acts. In regard to alienations for pious observances, which are not essential or obligatory, her powers are limited to alienating only a small portion of the property. Applying the principles accepted in Kamala Devi's case, the simple question for decision, in view of the fact that the Arpan-nama was executed for a merely pious purpose and not for an essential or obligatory purpose is whether the alienation effected by Kachnar Kuer in favour of the deity is of a reasonable portion of her husband's property. Respondents 1 and 2, in paragraph 7 of their plaint, passingly mentioned that Kachnar Kuer had transferred \"a considerable portion\" of the properties left by her husband. In paragraph 13 of the written statement which Kachnar Kuer filed on behalf of herself and her adopted son, it was stated that in view of the fact that Trilok Prasad Singh had left about 150 Bighas of land, the alienation of about 30 Bighas in favour of the deity could not be said to be unreasonable or excessive. One hundred and fifty Bighas are treated in the area as roughly equal to 90 acres so that 30 Bighas come to about 18 acres. Whether the alienation for a pious purpose is of a reasonable portion of the property must necessarily depend upon the total extent of the property which has devolved upon the widow. The mere circumstance that a 100 acres are alienated by the widow for a pious purpose will not justify the setting aside of the alienation on the ground that 100 acres is large property. The High Court, without adverting to the fact that the widow had alienated only a one fifth portion of the property which had devolved upon her, held that \"a dedication of a large part of the property, more than 18 acres of land, cannot be defended on the part of a holder of a widow's estate -\". This is all that the High Court has to say on the point and obviously, what it has said is not enough or relevant for invalidating the alienation. Whether the alienation is of a reasonable portion of the property is not a matter to be decided on precedents because what is reasonable must depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. But an alienation of a one-fifth portion cannot be said to be unreasonable or excessive. The finding of the High Court must therefore be set aside and along with it its judgment allowing the reversioner's appeal and decreeing their suit. We therefore hold that the Arpan-nama executed by Kachnar Kuer in favour of the deity is lawful and valid. In the result we allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the High Court and direct that the suit filed by respondents 1 and 2 shall stand dismissed with costs. S.R.

Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated February 12, 1960, of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, in Writ Petition number 5 of 1960. P. A. Choudhuri and K. R. Choudhuri, for the appellants. P. Ram Reddy, for respondents numbers 1, 2 and 6 to 11. 1960. November 7. The Judgment of Gajendragadkar, Subha Rao, Wanchoo and,. Mudholkar, JJ.,298 was delivered by Subba Rao, J. Sarkar, J., delivered a separate judgment. SUBBA RAO J.-This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad dismissing the petition filed by the appellants under article 226 of the Constitution to issue a writ of quo warranto against respondents 1 to 10 directing them to exhibit an information as to the authority under which they are functioning as members of the Vicarabad Municipal Committee and to restrain them from selling certain plots of land belonging to the Municipality to third parties. Vica- rabad was originally situate in the Part B State of Hyderabad and is now in the State of Andhra Pradesh. The Municipal Committee of Vicarabad was constituted under the Hyderabad Municipal and Town Committees Act (XXVII of 1951). In the year 1953 respondents 1 to 10 were elected, and five others, who are not parties before us, were nominated, to that Committee. On November 27, 1953, the Rajpramukh of the State of Hyderabad published a notification under the relevant Acts in the Hyderabad Government Gazette Extraordinary notifying the above persons as members of the said Committee. Presumably with a view to democratize the local institutions in that part of the country and to bring them on a par with those prevailing in the neighbouring States, the Hyderabad District Municipalities Act, 1956 (XVIII of 1956), (hereinafter referred to as the Act), was passed by the Hyderabad _ Legislature and it received the assent of the President on August 9, 1956. Under section 320 of the Act the Hyderabad Municipal and Town Committees Act, 1951 (XXVII of 1951) and other connected Acts were repealed. As a transitory measure, under the same section any Committee constituted under the enactment so repealed was deemed to have been constituted under the Act and the members of the said Committee were to continue to hold office till the first meeting of the Committee was called under section 35 of the Act. Under that provision respondents 1 to 10 and the five nominated members continued to function as members of the Municipal Committee. In or about the year 1958 the said Committee acquired land measuring acres 15-7 guntas described as \" Varad Raja Omar Bagh \" for Rupees 18,000 for the purpose of establishing a grain market (gunj). For one reason or other, the Municipal Committee was not in a position to construct the grain market and run it departmentally. The Committee, therefore, after taking the permission of the Government, resolved by a requisite majority to sell the said land to third parties with a condition that the vendee or vendees should construct a building or buildings for running a grain market. There- after the Committee sold the land in different plots to third parties ; but the sale deeds were not executed in view of the interim order made in the writ petition by the High Court and subsequently in the appeal by this Court. In the writ petition the appellants contended, inter alia, that the respondents ceased to be members of the Municipal Committee on the expiry of three years from the date the new Act came into force and that, therefore, they had no right to sell the land, and that, in any view, the sale made by the Committee of the property acquired for the purpose of constructing a market was ultra vires the provisions of the Act. The respondents contested the petition on various grounds. The learned Judges of the High Court dismissed the petition with costs for the following reasons: 1. The old Committee will continue to function till a new Committee comes into existence. 2. \" Section 76 contemplates that property vested in it under section 72(f), 73 and 74 should be transferred only to Government. Here, the transfer is not in favour of the Government. That apart we are told that in this case sanction of the Government was obtained at every stage. It cannot be predicated that the purpose for which the properties are being disposed of is not for a, public purpose. It is not disputed that the properties are being sold only to persons who are required to build grain market \". 3. The act now opposed is not in any way in conflict with the provisions of ss. 244, 245 and 247.4. \" It looks to us that the petitioners lack in bona fides and that this petition is not conceived in the interests of the public \". The present appeal, as aforesaid, was filed by special leave granted by this Court. Mr. P. A. Chowdury, learned counsel for the appellants, canvassed the correctness of the findings of the High Court. His first argument may be summarized thus: Under section 320 of the Act any Committee constituted under the repealed enactment shall be deemed to have been constituted under the Act and the members of the said Committee shall continue to hold office till the first meeting of the Committee is called under section 35 of the Act. Under section 35 of the Act, the first meeting of the Committee shall not be held on a date prior to the date on which the term of the outgoing members expires under section 34. Section 34 of the Act provides that the members shall hold office for a term of three years. Therefore, the term of the members of the Committee deemed to have been constituted under section 320 is three years from the date on which the Act came into force. If the term fixed Under section 34 does not apply to the members of the said Committee, the result will be that the said members will continue to hold office indefinitely, for the first meeting of the Committee could not be legally convened under the Act as section 16 which enables the Collector to do so imposes a duty on him to hold a general election within three months before the expiry of the term of office of the members of the Committee as specified in section 34, and, as no definite term has been prescribed for the members of the Committee under section 320, the election machinery fails, with the result that the members of the \" deemed \" Committee would continue to be members of the said Committee indefinitely. On this inter- pretation learned counsel contends that the section would be void for the following reasons: (1) section 320(1)(a) of the Act would be ultra vires the powers of the State Legislature under article 246 of the Constitution, read with entry 5, List II, VII Schedule; (2) the said section deprives the appellants of the right to equality and protection of the laws guaranteed under article 14 of the Constitution; (3) section 320 would be void also as inconsistent with the entire scheme of the provisions of the Act. Let us first test the validity of the construction of section 320 of the Act suggested by the learned counsel. The material part of section 320 reads: \" (1) The Hyderabad Municipal and Town Committees Act, 1951, (XXVII of 1951)........................ (is) hereby repealed ; provided that:- (a) any Committee constituted under the enactment so repealed (hereinafter referred to in this section as the said Committee) shall be deemed to have been constituted under this Act, and Members of the said Committee shall continue to hold office till the first meeting of the Committee is called under section 35;\". The terms of the section are clear and do not lend any scope for argument. The section makes a distinction between the \" said\" Committee and the Committee elected under the. Act and says, \" Members of the said Committee shall continue to hold office till the first meeting of the Committee is called under section 35 \". Though the word \" Committee\" is defined in section 2(5) to mean a Municipal or Town Committee established or deemed to be established under the Act, that definition must give way if there is anything repugnant in the subject or context. As the section makes a clear distinction between the \" said \" Committee and the Committee elected under the Act, in the context, the Committee in s. 320 cannot mean the Committee elected under the Act. The term fixed for the members of the Committee constituted under the Act cannot apply to the members of the Committee deemed to have been constituted under the Act. Section 32 which provides for the culminating stage of the process of election under the Act says that the names of all members finally elected to any Committee shall be forthwith published in the official Gazette. Section 34 prescribes the term of office of the members so elected. Under it, \" except as is otherwise provided in this Act, members shall hold office for a term of three years.\" Section 320(1)(a) provides a different term for the members of the Committee deemed to have been constituted under the Act. Thereunder, the term is fixed not by any number of years but by the happening of an event. The Committee constituted under section 320 clearly falls under the exception. But it is suggested that the exception refers only to section 28 whereunder a member of a, Committee ceases to be one by a supervening disqualification. Firstly, this section does not fix a term but only imposes a disqualification on the basis of a term fixed under section 34; secondly, assuming that the said section also fixes a term, the exception may as well cover both the deviations from the normal rule. That apart, sub-section (2) of section 34 dispels any doubt that may arise on the construction of sub-section (1) of the section. Under sub-section (2), the term of office of such members shall be deemed to commence on the date of the first meeting called by the Collector under section 35. Section 35 directs the Collector to call a meeting after giving at least five clear days notice within thirty days from the date of the publication of the names of members under section 32. This provision clearly indicates that the members of the Committee mentioned in section 34 are only the members elected under the Act and not members of tile Committee deemed to have been elected under the Act, for, in the case of the latter Committee, no publication under section 32 is provided for and therefore the provisions of section 35 cannot apply to them. It is, therefore, manifest that the term prescribed in section 34 cannot apply to a member of the deemed \" Committee. Let us now see whether this interpretation would necessarily lead us to hold that the members of the \" deemed \" Committee under section 320(1)(a) would have an indefinite duration. This result, it is suggested, would flow from a correct interpretation of the relevant provisions of section 16 of the Act. The judgment of the High Court does not disclose that any argument was addressed before that Court on the basis of section 16 of the Act. But we allowed the learned counsel to raise the point as in effect it is only a link in the chain of his argument to persuade us to hold in his favour on the construction of section 320. Before we consider this argument in some detail, it will be convenient at this stage to notice some of the well established rules of Construction which would help us to steer clear of the complications created by the Act. Maxwell \" On the Interpretation of Statutes\", 10th Edn., says at p. 7 thus: \".............. if the choice is between two inter- pretations, the narrower of which would fail to achieve the manifest purpose of the legislation, we should avoid a construction which would reduce the legislation to futility and should rather accept the bolder construction based on the view that Parliament would legislate only for the purpose of bringing about an effective result.\" It is said in Craies on Statute Law, 5th Edn., at p. 82-- Manifest absurdity or futility, palpable injustice, or absurd inconvenience or anomaly to be avoided.') Lord Davey in Canada Sugar Refining Co. v. R. provides another useful guide of correct perspective to such a problem in the following words: \" Every clause of a statute should be construed with reference to the context and the other clauses of the Act, so as, so far as possible, to make a consistent enactment of the whole statute or series of statutes relating to the subject-matter.\" To appreciate the problem presented and to give an adequate answer to the same, it would be necessary and convenient to notice the scheme of the Act as reflected in the relevant sections, namely, ss. 16, 17, 18, 20, 32, 34 and 320. The said scheme of the Act may be stated thus: Under the Act, there are general elections and elections to casual vacancies. The general elections may be in regard to the first election after the Act came into force or to the subsequent elections under the Act. Section 5 imposes a duty on the Government to constitute a Municipal Committee for each town and notify the date when it shall come into existence. Section 17 enjoins on the Government to issue a notification calling upon all the constituencies to elect members in accordance (1) [1898] A.C. 735. with the provisions of the, Act on or before such date or dates as may be specified in the said notification. Section 16 imposes a duty upon the Collector to hold a general election in the manner prescribed within three months before the expiry of the term of office of the members of the Committee as specified in section 34 of the Act. Sub-section (2) of section 16 provides for a bye-election for filling up of a casual vacancy. Section 18 enables the Collector with the approval of the Government to designate or nominate a Returning Officer. Section 19 imposes a duty upon such an officer to do all such acts and things as may be necessary for effectually conducting the election in the manner provided by the Act and the rules made there under. Section 20 authorizes the Collector to issue a notification in the Official Gazette appointing the dates for making nominations, for the scrutiny of nominations, for the withdrawal of candidatures and for the holding of the poll. After the elections are held in the manner prescribed, the names of all the members finally elected to any Committee shall be published in the Official Gazette. Except as other,wise provided in the Act, section 34 prescribes the term of three years for a member so elected. As a transitory provision till such an election is held, section 320 says that the members of the previous Committee constituted under the earlier Act shall be deemed to be constituted under the Act and the members thereof shall hold office till the first meeting of the Committee is called under section 35 of the Act. It is clear from the aforesaid provisions that the Government notifies the dates calling upon all the constituencies to elect the members before such date or dates prescribed; the Collector holds the election and fixes the dates for the various stages of the process of election ; the Returning Officer appointed by the Collector does all acts and things necessary for effectually conducting the election. On the general scheme of the Act we do not see any legal objection to the Collector holding the first elections under the Act. The legal obstacle for such a course is sought to be raised on the wording of section 16(1).Every general election requisite for the purpose of this Act shall be held by the Collector in the manner prescribed within three months before the expiry of the term of office of the members of the Committee as specified in section 34.\" The argument is that the Collector's power to hold a general election is confined to section 16(1) and, as in the case of the members of the Committee deemed to have been constituted under the Act the second limb of the section cannot apply and as the Collector's power is limited by the second limb of the section, the Collector has no power to hold the first general election under the Act. If this interpretation be accepted, the Act would become a dead-letter and-the obvious intention of the Legislature would be defeated. Such a construction cannot be accepted except in cases of absolute intractability of the language used. While the Legislature repealed the earlier Act with an express intention to constitute new Committees on broad based democratic principles, by this interpretation the Committee under the old Act perpetuates itself indefinitely. In our view, section 16(1) does not have any such effect. Section 16(1) may be read along with the aforesaid other relevant provisions of the Act. If so read, it would be clear that it could not apply to the first election after the Act came into force, but should be confined to subsequent elections. So far as the first general election is concerned, there is a self-contained and integrated machinery for holding the election without in any way calling in aid the provisions of section 16(1). Section 17 applies to all elections, that is, general as well as bye- elections. It applies to the first general election as well as subsequent general elections. The proviso to that section says that for the purpose of holding elections under sub-section (1) of section 16 no such notification shall be issued at any time earlier than four months before the expiry of the term of office of the members of the Committee as specified in section 34. The proviso can be given full meaning, for it provides only for a case covered by section 16(1) and, as the first general election is outside the scope of section 16(1),306 it also falls outside the scope of the proviso to S. 17. Under section 17, therefore, the Government, in respect of the first general election, calls upon all the constituencies to elect members before the date or dates fixed by it. Under section 20, the Collector fixes the dates for the various stages of the election. The Returning Officer does all the acts and things necessary for conducting the election and when the election process is completed, the names of the members elected are published. All these can be done without reference to section 16(1), for the Collector is also empowered under section 20 to hold the elections. In this view, there cannot be any legal difficulty for conducting the first election, after the Act came into force. If so, the term of the members of the Committee deemed to have been elected would come to an end when the first meeting of the Committee was called under section 35. The Legislature in enacting the law not only assumed but also expected that the Government would issue the requisite notification under section 17 of the Act within a reasonable time from the date when the Act came into force. The scheme of the Act should be judged on that basis; if so judged, the sections disclose an integrated scheme giving section 320 a transitory character. It is conceded by learned counsel that if section 320(1)(a) is constructed in the manner we do, the other points particularised above do not arise for consideration. Before leaving this part of the case we must observe that the difficulty is created not by the provisions of the Act but by the fact of the Government not proceeding under section 17 of the Act within a reasonable time from the date on which the Act came into force. This is a typical case of the legislative intention being obstructed or deflected by the inaction of the executive. Mr. Ram Reddy, learned counsel for the respondents, states that there are many good reasons why the Government did not implement the Act. There may be many such reasons, but when the Legislature made an Act in 1956, with a view to democratize municipal administration in that part of the country so as to bring it on a par with that obtaining in other States, it is no answer to say that the Government had good reasons for not implementing the Act. If the Government had any such reasons, that might be an occasion for moving the Legislature to repeal the Act or to amend it. If the affected parties had filed a writ of mandamus in time, this situation could have been avoided ; but it was not done. We hope and trust that the Government would take immediate steps to hold elections to the Municipal Committee so that the body constituted as early as 1953, under a different Act could be replaced by an elected body under the Act. Even so, learned counsel for the appellants contends that the Municipal Committee had no power to sell the land acquired by it for constructing a market. To appreciate this contention it would be convenient to notice the relevant provisions of the Act.Under section 72(f) all land or other property transferred to the Committee by the Government or the District Board or acquired by gift, purchase, or otherwise for local purposes shall vest in and be under the control of the Committee. Section 73 enables the Government, in consultation with the Committee, to direct that any property, movable or immovable, which is vested in it, shall vest in such Committee. Section 74 empowers the Government on the request of the Committee to acquire any land for the purposes of the Act. Under section 76, the Committee may, with the sanction of the Government, transfer to the Government any property vested in the Committee under ss. 72(f), 73 and 74, but not so as to affect any trust or public right subject to which the property is held. Learned counsel contends that, as the land was acquired by the Committee for the construction of a market, the Committee has power to transfer the same to the Government only subject to the conditions laid down in s. 76, and that it has no power to sell the land to third parties. This argument ignores the express intention of s. 77 of the Act. Section 77 says: \" Subject to such exceptions as the Government may by general or special order direct, no Committee shall transfer any immovable property except in pursuance of a resolution passed at a meeting by amajority of not less than two-third of the whole number of members and in accordance with rules made under this Act, and no Committee shall transfer any property which has been vested in it by the Government except with the sanction of the Government: Provided that nothing in this section shall apply to leases of immovable property for a term not exceeding three years \". This section confers on the Committee an express power couched in a negative form. Negative words are clearly prohibitory and are ordinarily used as a legislative device to make a statute imperative. If the section is recast in an affirmative form, it reads to the effect that the Committee shall have power to transfer any immovable property, if the conditions laid down under the section are complied with. The conditions laid down are: (1) there shall be a resolution passed at a meeting by a majority of not less than two-third of the whole number of members of the Committee; (2) it shall be in accordance with the rules made under the Act; (3) in the case of a property vested in it by the Government, the transfer can be made only with the sanction of the Government; and (4) the sale is not exempted by the Government, by general or special order, from the operation of section 77 of the Act. It is not disputed that the relevant conditions have been complied with in the present case. If so, the power of the Committee to alienate the property cannot be questioned. Learned counsel contends that the provisions of section 76 govern the situation and that section 77 may apply only to a property vested in the Committee under provisions other than those of ss. 72(f), 73 and 74, and that further, if a wider interpretation was given to section 77, while under section 76 the transfer in favour of the Government would be subject to a trust or public right, under section 77 it would be free from it if it was transferred to a private party. The first objection has no force, as there are no sections other than ss. 72, 73 and 74 whereunder the Government vests property in a Committee. The second objection also has no merits, for the trust or public right-mentioned in section 76 does not appear to relate to the purpose for which the property is purchased but to the trust or public right existing over the property so alienated by the Committee. Further the proviso to section 77, which says, \" nothing in this section shall apply to leases of immovable property for a term not exceeding three years \", indicates that the main section applies also to the property vested in the Committee under the previous section, for it exempts from the operation of the operative part of section 77 leases for a term not exceeding three years in respect of properties covered by the preceding section and other sections. This interpretation need not cause any apprehension that a Com- mittee may squander away the municipal property, for section 77 is hedged in by four conditions and the conditions afford sufficient guarantee against improper and improvident alienations. In this context learned counsel for the appellants invoked the doctrine of law that an action of a statutory corporation may be ultra vires its powers without being illegal and also the principle that when a statute confers an express power, a power inconsistent with that expressly given cannot be implied. It is not necessary to consider all the decisions cited, as learned counsel for the respondents does not canvass the correctness of the said principles. It would, therefore, be sufficient to notice two of the decisions cited at the Bar. The decision in Elizabeth Dowager Baroness Wenlock v. The River Dee Company (1) is relied upon in support of the proposition that when a corporation is authorised to do an act subject to certain conditions, it must be deemed to have been prohibited to do the said act except in accordance with the provisions of that Act which confers the authority on it. Where by Act 14 & 15 Viet. a company was empowered to borrow at interest for the purposes of the concerned Acts, subject to certain conditions, it was held that the company was prohibited by the said Act from borrowing except in accordance with the provisions of that Act. Strong reliance is placed on the decision in Attorney-General v. Fulham Corporation (1) (1885) 10 A.C. 354. (2) (1921) 1 Ch.D. 440.There, in exercise of the powers conferred under the Baths and Wash-houses Acts the Metropolitan Borough of Fulham propounded a scheme in substitution of an earlier one whereunder it installed a wash-house to which persons resorted for washing their clothes bringing their own wash materials and utilised the facilities offered by the municipality on payment of the prescribed charges. Sarjant, J., held that the object of the legislation was to provide for persons who became customers facilities for doing their own washing, but the scheme provided for washing by the municipality itself and that, therefore, it was ultra vires the statute. In coming to that conclusion the learned Judge, after considering an earlier decision on the subject, applied the following principle to the facts of the case before him : \" That recognises that in every case it is for a corporation of this kind to show that it has affirmatively an authority to do particular acts; but that in applying that principle, the rule is not to be applied too narrowly, and the corporation is entitled to do not only that which is expressly authorised but that which is reasonably incidental to or consequential upon that which is in terms authorized.\" The principle so stated is unobjectionable. The correctness of these principles also need not be canvassed, for the construction we have placed on the provisions of the Act does not run counter to any of these principles. We have held that section 77 confers an express power on the Municipal Committee to sell property subject to the conditions mentioned therein. Therefore, the impugned sales are not ultra vires the powers of the Committee. In view of the said express power, no prohibition can be implied from the provisions of section 76. Learned counsel further contends that the statutory power can be exercised only for the purposes sanctioned by the statute, that the sales of the acquired land to private persons were not for one of such purposes, and that, therefore, they were void. The principle that a statutory body can only function within the statute is unexcecutionable; but the Legislature can confer a power on a statutory corporation to sell its land is equally uncontestable. In this case we have held that the statute conferred such a power on the Municipal Committee, subject to stringent limitations. Many situations can be visualized when such a sale would be necessary and would be to the benefit of the corporation. of course the price fetched by such sales can only be utilised for the purposes sanctioned by the Act. The last point raised is that the learned Judges of the High Court were not justified in holding on the materials placed before them that the appellants lacked bona fides and that the petition filed by them was not conceived in the interests of the public. We do not find any material on the record to sustain this finding. Indeed, but for the petitioner-appellants the extraordinary situation created by the inaction of the Government in the matter of implementing the Act, affecting thereby the municipal administration of all the districts in Telangana area, might not have been brought to light. We cannot describe the action of the appellants either mala fide or frivolous. In the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed but, in the circumstances, without costs. SARKAR, J.-The first question is whether the first ten respondents are still members of the Municipal Committee of Vicarabad. These persons had been elected to the Committee in the elections held in 1953 under the Hyderabad Municipal and Town Commit tees Act, 1951 (Hyderabad Act XXVII of 1951), hereafter called the repealed Act. That Act was repealed by the Hyderabad District Municipalities Act (Hyderabad Act XVIII of 1956), hereafter called the new Act, which came into force in August 1956. The appellants, who are rate-payers of the Municipality, contend that on a proper reading of the new Act, it must be held that these ten respondents have ceased to be members of the Committee, and they seek a writ of quo warranto against the respondents. Section 320 of the new Act provides that any Committee constituted under the repealed Act shall be deemed to have been constituted under the new Actand its members shall continue to hold office till the first meeting of the Committee is called under section 35 of the new Act. The ten respondents contend that as admittedly the meeting under section 35 has not been called, their term of office has not yet expired. Now section 35, so far as is material, provides that the first meeting of the Committee shall be called by the Collector within thirty days of the date of publication of the names of members under section 32. Section 32 states that the names of members finally elected to any Committee shall be forthwith published in the official Gazette. It is quite clear, therefore, that the Committee mentioned in this section, is a Committee constituted by an election held under the new Act. It would follow that the meeting contemplated in section 35 is a meeting of a Committee constituted by an election held under the new Act. The provisions of that section put this beyond doubt. In order, therefore, that a meeting of the Committee contemplated in section 35 may be held, there has first to be an election under the new Act to constitute the Committee. No such election has yet been held. It is the provision concerning election in the new Act that has given rise to the difficulty that arises in this case. Section 16, sub-s. (1), gives the power to hold the general elections. It is in these words: Every general election requisite for the purpose of this Act shall be held by the Collector in the manner prescribed within three months before the expiry of the term of office of the members of the Committee as specified in section 34 \". Section 34 in substance states that except as other. wise provided members of the Committee shall hold office for a term of three years and that term of office shall be deemed to commence on the date of the first meeting called under s. 35. It would therefore appear that the members whose term of office is sought to be specified by section 34 are members elected under the new Act, for their term is to commence on the date that they first meet under section 35 and as earlier stated, the meeting under section 35 is a meeting of members elected under the new Act. The contention for the appellants is that if a. 34 is construed in the way mentioned above, the first general election under the new Act cannot be held under section 16, for an election can be held under that section only within three months before the expiry of the term of office of members elected under the new Act and in the case of first election there are ex hypothesi, no such members. It is said that as there is no other provision in the new Act for holding a general election, the Act would then become unworkable, for if the first general election cannot be held no subsequent election can be held either., The result, it is contended, is that the Committee elected under the repealed Act would continue for ever by virtue of section 320. Such a situation, it is said, could not have been intended by the new Act. It is therefore suggested that section 34 should be construed as specifying a term of office of three years from the commencement of the new Act for members elected under the repealed Act who are under section 320, to be deemed to form a Committee constituted under the new Act. If section 34 is so construed, then the first general election under the new Act can properly be held under section 16. It is on this basis that the appellants contend that the ten respondents' term of office expired in August, 1959, and they are in possession of the office now without any warrant. There is no doubt that the Act raises some difficulty. It was certainly not intended that the members elected to the Committee under the repealed Act should be given a permanent tenure of office nor that there would be no elections under the new Act. Yet such a result would appear to follow if the language used in the new Act is strictly and literally interpreted. It is however well established that \" Where the language of a statute, in its ordinary meaning and grammatical construction, leads to a manifest contradiction of the apparent purpose of the enactment, or to some inconvenience or absurdity, hardship or in justice, presumably not intended, a construction may be put upon it which modifies the meaning of the words, and even the structure of the sentence..................314 Where the main object and intention of a statute are clear, it must not be reduced to a nullity by the draftsman's unskilfulness or ignorance of the law, except in a case of necessity, or the absolute intractability of the language used. Nevertheless, the courts are very reluctant to substitute words in a Statute, or to add words to it, and it has been said that they will only do so where there is a repugnancy to good Bense.\": see Maxwell on Statutes (10th ed.) p. 229. In Seaford Court Estates Ltd. v. Asher (1), Denning, L. J., said, \" when a defect appears a judge cannot simply fold his hands and blame the draftsman. He must set to work on the constructive task of finding the intention of Parliament.............. and then he must supplement the written word so as to give \" force and life \" to the intention of the legislature............... A judge should ask himself the question how, if the makers of the Act had themselves come across this ruck in the texture of it, they would have straightened it out ? He must then do as they would have done. A judge must not alter the material of which the Act is woven, but he can and should iron out the creases.\" I conceive it my duty, therefore, so to read the new Act, unless I am prevented by the intractability of the language used, as to make it carry out the obvious intention of the legislature. Now there does not seem to be the slightest doubt that the intention of the makers of the new Act was that there should be elections held under it and that the Municipal Committees should be constituted by such elections to run the administration of the municipalities. The sections to which I have so far referred and the other provisions of the new Act make this perfectly plain. Thus section 5 provides for the establishment of municipal committees and section 8 states that the committees shall consist of a certain number of elected members. The other sections show that the Committees shall have charge of the administration of the municipalities for the benefit of the dwellers within them. It is plain (1) [1949] 2 All E.R. 155 ,164.that the entire object of the new Act would fail if no general election could be held under it. The question then is, How should the Act be read so as to make it possible to hold general elections under it ? I agree with the learned advocate for the appellants that the only section in the new Act providing for general elections being held, is section 16(1). In my view, section 20 does not authorise the holding of any general election; it only provides for a notification of the date on which the poll shall, if necessary, be taken. There is no doubt that under section 16(1) the second and all subsequent general elections can be held ; in regard to such general elections, no difficulty is created by the language of the section. It would be curious if section 20 also provided for general elections, for then there would be two provisions in the Act authorising general elections other than the first. Then I find hat all the sections referring to general elections refer to such elections being held under section 16(1) and not under section 20. Thus section 31 provides that if at a general election held under section 16, no member is elected, a fresh election shall be held. It would follow that if in an election under section 20, assuming that that section authorises an election, no member is elected, no fresh election can be held. There would be no reason to make this distinction between elections held under section 16 and under section 20. Again the proviso to section 17 requires a certain notification to be issued within a prescribed time for holding elections under section 16(1). If an election can be held under section 20, no such notification need be issued for there is no provision requiring it. This could not have been intended. For all these reasons it seems to me that s. 20 does not confer any power to hold any election. I have earlier said that the suggestion for the appellants is that the best way out of the difficulty is to read section 34 as specifying a term of office of three years commencing from the coming into force of the new Act, for the members elected under the repealed Act who are to be deemed under s. 320 to be a committee constituted under the new Act. It seems to me that this is not a correct solution of the problem. First,the object of continuing the members elected under the repealed Act in office is clearly to have, what may be called a caretaker committee to do the work of the Municipality till a committee is constituted by election under the new Act. It could not have been intended that the committee of the members elected under the repealed Act would function for three years after the new Act has come into operation nor that such members would have the same term of office as members elected under the new Act. Secondly, I do not find the language used in section 34 sufficiently tractable to cover by any alteration, a member elected under the repealed Act. To meet the suggestion of the appellants, a new provision would have really to be enacted and added to section 34 and this I do not think is permissible. It would be necessary to add to the section a provision that in the case of members elected under the old Act the term of office of three years would start running from the commencement of the new Act, a provision which is wholly absent in the section as it stands. Lastly, so read, section 34 would come into conflict with section 320 which expressly provides that the term of office of the members elected under the repealed Act would continue till the first meeting of the committee constituted under the new Act is held under section 35. This portion of section 320 would have to be completely struck out. It seems to me that the real solution of the difficulty lies in construing section 16(1) so as to authorise the holding of the first general election under it and remove the absurdity of there being no provision directing the first general election to be held. Now that section applies to ,every general election requisite for the purpose of this Act.\" It therefore applies to the first and all other general elections. The clear intention hence is that the first general election will also be held under this provision.But such election cannot be held within the time mentioned therein for that time has to be calculated from the expiry of the term of office of the Committee elected under the Act and in the case of the first general election under the new Act, there is no such Committee. The requirementas to time cannot apply to the first general election. The section has therefore to be read as if there was no such requirement in the case of the first general election. It will have to be read with the addition of the words \" provided that every general election excepting the first general election shall be held \" between the words \" prescribed \" and \" within \". That would 'carry out the intention of the legislature and do the least violence to the language used. So read, there would be clear power under the Act to hold the first general meeting. There would of course then be no indication as to when this election is to be held but that would only mean that it has to be held within a reasonable time of the commencement of the new Act. The course suggested by me is not without the support of precedents. Thus in Salmon v. Duncombe (1), the Judicial Committee in construing a statute omitted from it the words \" as if such natural born subject resided in England \" because the retention of those words would have prevented the person contemplated getting full power to dispose of his immovable property by his will which it was held, the object of the statute was, he should get. With regard to the other point argued in this .appeal, namely, whether the Municipal Committee even if properly constituted, has power to sell the land mentioned in the petition, I agree, for the reasons mentioned in the judgment delivered by the majority of the members of the bench, that it has such power and have nothing to add. The appeal therefore fails. Appeal dismissed.

Govind Das and J.R. Das for the Appellant. S.C. Manchanda, Miss A. Subhashini and K.C. Dua for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by PATHAK J. This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of the High Court of Orissa disposing of an Income-tax Reference and answering the following question in favour of the revenue and against the assessee: \"Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, the loss of Rupees 30,045 claimed by the assessee is a capital loss or a revenue loss?\" The assessee is a private limited company carrying on business as a contractor. In April 1964 it entered into a contract with the South-Eastern Railway Administration for the execution of earth work, bridge work and other miscellaneous works required for the construction of a new railway yard. As it was required to supply earth outsidethe railway land the assessee found it expedient to buy two pieces of land from which earth could be excavated and conveniently taken to the work site. One piece of land was acquired at a cost of Rupees 53,196 during the calendar year 1964 corresponding to the assessment year 1965-66, and the other piece of land was acquired for Rupees 15,045 during the calendar year pertaining to the assessment year 1966-67, bringingthe total cost to Rupees 68,241. Soon after the work was over, the assessee sold both lands for a sum of Rupees 23,000, thereby sustaining a loss of Rupees 45,241. The assessee treated this as the value of the excavated earth, and apportioned the amount in its accounts in the following manner, Rupees 8,196 as the cost of the earth for the assessment year 1965-66, Rupees 30,045 towards the earth excavated in the assessment year 1966-67, and Rupees 7,000 towards the earth excavated for the assessment year 1967-68. The Income-tax Officer accepted the claim for the assesment year 1965-66. The claim of the assessee to a deduction of Rupees 30,045 for the assessment year 1966-67 was disallowed on the ground that it represented a capital loss. The assessee proceeded in first appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner of Income-tax but the appeal was dismissed. A second appeal was allowed by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal on the ground that the land formed a wasting asset and by constant digging of the earth the land had become unserviceable. On a reference being made to the High Court of Orissa at the instance of the Commissioner of Income-tax on the question of law set forth earlier the High Court held that the loss of Rupees 30,045 claimed by the assessee was a capital loss and therefore, the assessee was not'entitled to a deduction. The question in this appeal before us is a short one. Can it be said that the loss of Rupees 30,045 is a capital loss or a revenue loss? It is not in dispute that the assessee did not deal in land. It was a contractor and it had acquired the land for the purpose of obtaining a ready supply of earth in order to fulfil the contract with the Railway Administration. The land was not its stock-in-trade. What it needed as raw material for the purpose of the contract was loose earth and this it obtained by the process of excavation from the land. Moreover, the two pieces of land were shown as fixed assets by the assessee itself in its balance-sheet. Learned counsel for the assessee relies on M.A. Jabbar v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Andhra Pradesh, [1968] 68 I.T.R. 493, 497-8 but that is a case where the land was taken on lease for a limited period of 11 months with the right to enter, occupy and use for a quarrying purpose and to render marketable and carry away sand within or on the land. This Court held that the lease money paid by the assessee was deductible as revenue expenditure. The Court referred to the short period of the lease, which indicated that the lease was not an asset of an enduring nature, that the only right under the lease was to take away the sand lying on the land, and in fact as the sand lay on the surface no question arose of digging and excavating for the sand, and no operations were to be performed on the land. The Court laid great emphasis on the circumstance that the assessee did not acquire the land. Therefore, the Court held that the assessee \"did not acquire any fixed or capital asset of an enduring nature.\" The facts in the present case are entirely different. Here, the assessee was full proprietor of the two pieces of land and for an indefinite period. The reason for acquiring the land was no doubt to provide a ready supply of earth to the work site nearby, but there was nothing to prevent the assessee from continuing as owner of the land even after the railway contract had been executed and putting it to any other use. The land was treated by the assessee as its fixed asset. In all the circumstances of the case, the two pieces of land must be regarded as capital assests, and the loss claimed by the assessee must be regarded as a capital loss. The High Court is right in the view taken by it, and the appeal is liable to be dismissed. The appeal is dismissed with costs. A.P.J.

Appeals by Special Leave from the Judgment and order dated 10-10-1968 of the Rajasthan High Court in C.S.A. numbers 18 and 29, 27, 28. 30-35 of 1960 and 54 and 58 of 1961. S. N. Jain and S. K. Jain for the Appellants. B. P. Maheshwari and Suresh Sethi for the Respondent. The Judgment af the Court was delivered by SHINGHAL, J.,-These appeals by special leave arise out of a common judgment of the Rajasthan High Court dated October 10, 1968, by which the suits which were filed by the present appellants were dismissed in pursuance of the earlier judgment of the same court dated November 9, 1964, on the ground that they were governed by section 179(2) of the Rajasthan Town Municipalities Act, 1951, hereinafter referred to as the Act, and were barred by limitation. The facts giving rise to the appeals were different in details, but they were examined in the High Court with reference to the common questions of law which arose in all of them and formed the basis of that Court's, decision against the plaintiffs. We have heard these as companion appeals, and will decide them by a common judgment. It is not necessary to give the detailed facts of all the cases as it will be enough to refer to the suit which was filed by M/s Surajmal Banshidhar and the developments connected with it, in order to appreciate the controversy. The plaintiff firm referred to above carried on business in \"pakka arat\" and exported goods of various kinds from Ganganagar. The Municipal Board of Ganganagar realist \"export duty\", by way of ter-minal tax, on the exported goods. The plaintiff therefore raised a suit on October 19, 1957, challenging the Board's right to \"impose or to reales\" any export duty during the period June 5, 1954 to March 10 1957, amounting to Rupees 10,729. It however confined the suit to the recovery of Rupees 10,000 alongwith interest and gave up the balance. The Board denied the claim in the suit and pleaded, inter alia, that the levy of the terminal tax was in accordance with the law and the suit was barred by limitation. The trial court rejected the defence and decreed the suit, and its decree was upheld by the District Judge on appeal. Similar decrees were passed in the other suits, for various sums of money. The Board took the matter to the High Court in second appeals. The appeals were heard by a Single Judge who, while deciding that the suits were governed by section 179(2) of the Act, referred the question on the legality of the levy to a larger Bench. A Full Bench of the High Court held that the levy of the terminal tax was illegal, and sent the cases back to the Single Judge who allowed the appeals only for those amounts which were found to be within limitation under section 179(2) of the Act and dismissed the other suits. The plaintiffs obtained special leave and have come up to this Court in these circumstances. The question which arises for consideration is whether the suits fall within the purview of section 179(2) of the Act. The first two subsection of section 179 which bear on the controversy read as follows,- \"179. Limitation of suits, etc. -(1) No suit shall be instituted against any municipal board, president, member, officer, servant or any person acting under the direction of such municipal board, chairman, member, officer or servant for anything done or purporting to be done under this Act, until the expiration of two months next after notice in writing, stating the cause of action, the name and place of abode of the intending plaintiff and the relief which he claims, has been, in the case of a municipal board, delivered or left at its office, and, in case of a chairman, member, officer, or servant, or person as aforesaid, delivered to him or left at his office or usual place of abode; and the plaint shall contain a statement that such notice has been so delivered or left. (2) Every such suit shall, unless it is a suit for the recovery of immovable property or for a declaration of title thereto, be dismissed if it is not instituted within six months after the accrual of the alleged cause of action.\" The question therefore is whether the illegal levy of terminal tax (assuming that it was illegal as held by the High Court) could be said tobe a thing \"done or purporting to be done\" under the Act. A similar question arose for the consideration of this Court ill Poona City Municipal Corporation v. Dattatraya Nagesh Deodhar(l) with reference to the provision in section 127 (4) of the Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporation Act, 1949, and it was held that if the levy of a tax was prohibited by the Act concerned and was not in pursuance of it, it 'could not be said to be 'purported to be done in pursuance of execution or in tended execution of the Act'.\" It was observed that what was plainly prohibited by the Act could not be \"claimed to be purported to be done in pursuance or intended execution of the Act.\" It was therefore held that the suit was outside the purview of the section 127(4) and was not barred by limitation. We are in respectful agreement with that view, and we have no hesitation in holding, in the circumstances of the pre sent cases, which are governed by a provision similar to section 127(4) or the Poona City Municipal Corporation Act, that the suits did not fall within the purview of section 179 of the Act and were not barred by limitation. It may be mentioned that it has not been argued before us, and is nobody's case, that the suits would be barred by limitation even if they did not fall within the purview of section 179(2) of the Act. The decision of the High Court to the contrary is not correct and will have to be set aside. It has however been argued on behalf of the respondents that the High Court erred in taking the view that the levy of the terminal tax was illegal, and our attention has been invited to the relevant provisions of the law including the Bikaner State Municipal Act, 1923, article 277 of the Constitution and section 2 of the Act. It is not in controversy before us that the Bikaner State Municipal Act, 1923, authorised the levy of terminal tax and such a tax was levied by the Ganganagar Municipal Board under the authority of that law upto January 26, 1950, when the Constitution came into force. On and from that date, the power to levy export duty vested in the Parliament but article 277 saved that and some other taxes as follows,- \"277. Any taxes, duties, cesses or fees which, immediately before the commencement of this Constitution, were being law fully levied by the Government of any State or by any municipality or other local authority or body for the purposes of the State, municipality, district or other local area may, not withstanding that those taxes, duties, cesses or fees are mentioned in the Union list, continue to be levied and to be applied to the same purposes until provision to the contrary is made by Parliament by law.' (1) [1964] 8 S.C.R. 178.it was therefore permissible for the Municipal Board to continue to levy A the terminal tax until provision to the contrary was made by Parliament by law. But it so happened that the Bikaner Municipal Act, 1923 was repealed and the Act was brought into force with effect from December 22, 1951. Section 2(b) of the Act, which dealt with the repeal of the Bikaner Act and the saving of some of its provisions, expressly provided that on the coming into force of the Act, the laws and enactments specified in the First Schedule of the Act shall be repealed in so far as they relate to the Town Municipalities covered by the Act. So as the Bikaner State Municipal Act, 1923, was included in the first Schedule, it was repealed by the aforesaid section 2. That section however contained a proviso, clause (b) whereof was to the following effect,- \"(b) all town municipalities constituted under the said laws or enactments, and members appointed or elected, committees established, limits defined, appointments, rules, orders and bye-laws made, notifications and notices issued, taxes imposed, contracts entered into, and suits and other proceedings instituted, under the said laws or enactments or under and laws or enactments thereby repealed shall, so far as may be and so far as they relate to town municipalities be deemed, unless the Government directs otherwise, to have been respectively constituted, appointed, elected, establish ed\" defined, made, issued, imposed, entered into and instituted under this Act.\" The repeal did not therefore affect the validity of those taxes which had already been imposed and which could be \"deemed\" to have been imposed under the Act, unless there was a direction to the contrary by the State Government. It is quite clear from the provisions af the Act, and is in fact not disputed before us, that the terminal tax in question could not be imposed under any of the provisions of the Act. Its, levy could not therefore be saved by clause (b) of the proviso to section (2) of the Act. On the other hand, it could be said with justification that the State Legislature had decided to discontinue the levy by excluding it from the purview of the saving clause. The further levy of the tax therefore became illegal and it was not permissible to continue it any longer under article 277 which merely gave the authority concerned the option to continue the levy if it so desired. So as the levy of the tax after December 22, 1951, was illegal, there is nothing wrong with the view taken by the High Court that the amounts paid by the plaintiffs by way of terminal tax were recoverable by the suits which have given rise to these appeals, and there is no force in the argument to the contrary. The appeals are allowed with costs, the decrees of the High Court are set aside and those of the lower appellate court restored. P.B.R. Appeals allowed."}, "annotations": [{"result": [{"value": {"start": 0, "end": 29, "text": "CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION:", "labels": ["NONE"]}}, {"value": {"start": 30, "end": 67, "text": "Civil Appeal numbers 372-382 of 1969.", "labels": ["NONE"]}}, {"value": {"start": 68, "end": 239, "text": "Appeals by Special Leave from the Judgment and order dated 10-10-1968 of the Rajasthan High Court in C.S.A. numbers 18 and 29, 27, 28. 30-35 of 1960 and 54 and 58 of 1961.", "labels": ["NONE"]}}, {"value": {"start": 240, "end": 285, "text": "S.

Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated December 3, 1956, of the Allahabad High Court in Criminal Reference number 159 of 1956. N. C. Sen, for the appellant. C. K. Daphtary, Solicitor-General of India,. Purshottam Tricumdas, G. C. Mathur and C. P. Lal, for the respondent. 1960. April 1. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SUBBA RAO, J.--This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad rejecting the reference made by the learned Sessions Judge under S. 488 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The appellant is a minor and lives under the guardianship of his mother, Shrimati Gita Basu. On September 14, 1955, the appellant, through his mother, filed an application under s. 488 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as the Code) in the Court of the City Magistrate, Allahabad, praying for an order against the respondent, Advocate-General, Uttar Pradesh, Allahabad, for maintenance alleging that he is his putative father. Without giving notice to the respondent, the Magistrate posted the petition for evidence on September 20, 1955. On that date, the appellant's guardian was examined and she was also cross- examined by the Magistrate at some length.After she was examined, the Magistrate directed her to produce any further evidence she might like to lead under s. 202 of the Code and, for that purpose, he adjourned the petition for hearing to September 26, 1955, on which date one police constable was examined and the learned Magistrate made the endorsement that the applicant said that she would examine no other witness. On September 27, 1955, the appellant filed a petition before the Magistrate stating that section 200 of the Code had no application and that no enquiry need be made before issuing notice to the respondent. If, however, the Court treated the application as a complaint, the applicant asked for time to adduce further evidence in support of the application for maintenance. On that petition the learned Magistrate made the endorsement \" lead the further evidence, please, if you like \". On October 6, 1955, the guardian of the appellant examined one more witness. On that date, the learned Magistrate made in the proceeding sheet the endorsement no further evidence to be led at this stage On October 10, 1955, the learned Magistrate made an order dismissing the application. He agreed with the petitioner's contention that ss. 200 to 203 of the Code did not apply to the application for maintenance; but he expressed the view that he should be satisfied that the petitioner had a prima facie case before he issued notice to the respondent. He then proceeded to consider the evidence and came to the conclusion that he was not satisfied that the respondent was the father of Nand Lal, and on that finding he refused to issue notice of the application to the respondent, and dis- missed the application. The appellant filed a revision against that order of the learned Magistrate to the Sessions Judge, Allahabad. The learned Sessions Judge, after considering the materials placed before the Magistrate, came to the conclusion that it was a fit case in which the Magistrate ought to have issued summons to the respondent under sub-section (6) of section 488 of the Code. He submitted the record to the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad recommending that the order passed by the Magistrate be set aside and that the Magistrate be ordered to proceed with theapplication in accordance with law. The reference came up for hearing before Chowdhry, J., who, on the analogy of other sections of the Code held that the Magistrate in holding a preliminary enquiry acted in consonance with the general scheme of the Code and that, therefore, the order dismissing the application was not vitiated by any illegality or irregularity. He observed that it was conceded by the appellant before the Magistrate that the Magistrate could hold a preliminary enquiry and that, therefore, it was not open to the appellant to question its propriety. He also found that every opportunity was given to the guardian of the appellant to lead such evidence as he desired to produce and that, therefore, the appellant was not prejudiced by the alleged irregularity. On the main- tainability of the reference, he held that the finding arrived at by the learned Magistrate was one of fact on the materials placed on the record and, as the Magistrate did not act perversely or in contravention of some well- established principles of law or procedure, the learned Sessions Judge should not have made the reference. The learned Judge finally pointed out that the proceedings were only summary in nature and that they did not deprive the appellant of his right to seek remedy, if any, in a civil court. In the result, the reference was rejected. The appellant by this appeal questions the correctness of that order. Learned counsel for the appellant contends that the learned Magistrate followed a procedure not contemplated by the Code of Criminal Procedure and that in any event he conducted the enquiry in a manner which, to say the least, was unjust to the appellant. The learned Solicitor General, appearing for the respondent, supported the procedure adopted by the Magistrate and also the finding arrived at by him. He further contended that the appellant in the High Court as well as before the Magistrate conceded that the Magistrate had power to make a preliminary enquiry and that, therefore, he should not be allowed to question the validity of the enquiry for the first time before this Court. Ordinarily, in a case like this we should have been disinclined to interfere with the order of the HighCourt in an appeal filed under article 136 of the Constitution. But, this appeal discloses exceptional circumstances which compel us to depart from the ordinary practice. It is not correct to state that the appellant had conceded throughout that a Magistrate can make a preliminary enquiry under section 488 of the Code before issuing notice to the respondent. , Indeed the judgment of the Magistrate discloses that on behalf of the appellant certain decisions were cited in support of the contention that an application under section 488 of the Code does not come under the purview of ss. 200 to 203 of the Code. Section 200 of the Code provides for the examination of the complainant and the wit- nesses present in court. Section 202 enables him to make a further enquiry before issuing notice. Section 203 empowers him to dismiss a petition, if in his judgment no sufficient ground for proceeding with the case has been made out. The contention raised by the appellant, therefore, can only mean that the Magistrate -cannot make a preliminary enquiry in the manner contemplated by the said provisions. Indeed, the Magistrate accepted this contention; but he observed: \"But, as the learned counsel submit, I have to be satisfied that a notice under section 488 Criminal . P.C. should issue to the opposite party before issue it and that, therefore, all that has come on record as yet is admissible for consideration of the question whether the notice should be issued or not \". This observation did not record any concession on the part of the appellant that the Magistrate could make a preliminary enquiry. In the context of the first submission, the second submission could only mean that the Magistrate could satisfy himself before issuing notice, whether the application was ex facie not maintainable or frivolous. In the revision petition filed before the Sessions Judge, the appellant raised the following ground : \" Because the court below while correctly holding that application made by the applicant under section 488 Criminal . P. C. did not attract the operation of the provisions made in ss. 200 to 203 of the said Code and further that in pursuance of the mandatory provision in s, 488(6) all evidence underChapter XXXVI of the said Code shall be taken in the presence of the opposite party, has erred in law in directing evidence to be led under section 200 Criminal P. C. and in considering the said evidence has usurped a jurisdiction not vested in it by law.\" The judgment of the learned Sessions Judge also disclosed that this point was raised before him. Though the learned Sessions Judge accepted the contention that ss. 200 to 203 of the Code had no application, he remarked that \" in this case the learned Magistrate thought it fit to satisfy himself if this was a case fit enough in which he should issue a notice.\" Before the learned Judge of the High Court, it does not appear that any concession, even in a limited form, was made. Chowdhry, J., observes in his judgment \"...it appears that it was conceded by the learned counsel appearing for the applicant that the Magistrate had to satisfy himself in limine that a notice of the application in question should issue to the opposite party.\" This observation is only a reproduction of what the Magistrate stated in his judgment. Learned counsel, who appeared for the appellant in the High Court, does not appear to have made any fresh concession before the High Court and we do not think that the learned Judge was justified in drawing from the observations of the Magistrate that it was conceded on behalf of the applicant that it would be a pro-per procedure for the court to make such a preliminary enquiry in order to satisfy itself that notice should issue to the opposite party. As we have pointed out, the main contention of the petitioner throughout was that the Magistrate had no power to make a preliminary enquiry and the concession, even if it had been made, can only mean, in the context, that the Magistrate could satisfy himself whether, on the allegations in the petition, it was a frivolous petition. The first question is whether section 488 of the Code contemplates any preliminary enquiry on the part of a Magistrate before he could issue notice to the opposite party. The answer to this question turns upon the construction of the provisions of section 488 of the Code. Chapter XXXVI of the Code contains three provisions. The heading of the Chapter is \" of The Maintenance of Wives and Children\". The relevant provisions read: Section 488. (1) If any person having sufficient means neglects or refuses to maintain his wife or his legitimate or illegitimate child unable to maintain itself, the District Magistrate, a Presidency, Magistrate, a Sub- divisional Magistrate or a Magistrate of the first class may, upon proof of such neglect or refusal, order such person to make a monthly allowance for the maintenance of his wife or such child, at such monthly rate, not exceeding five hundred rupees in the whole, as such Magistrate thinks fit, and to pay the same to such person as the Magistrate from time to time directs. x x x (6) All evidence under this Chapter shall be taken in the presence of the husband or father, as the case may be, or when his personal attendance is dispensed with, in the presence of his pleader, and shall be recorded in the manner prescribed in the case of summons-cases: x x x Section 489 provides for the alteration in the allowance under section 488, and section 490 prescribes the procedure for the enforcement of the order of maintenance. The relief given tinder this Chapter is essentially of civil nature. It prescribes a summary procedure for compelling a man to maintain his wife or children. The findings of a magistrate under this Chapter are not final and the parties can legitimately agitate their rights in a civil court. This Chapter is a self-contained one. It recognizes the right of a child or wife to claim maintenance. It prescribes the procedure to be followed and provides for the enforcement of the decision of the magistrate. Under section 488, so far as it is relevant to the present enquiry, an illegitimate child unable to maintain itself is entitled to a monthly allowance for its maintenance, if the putative father having sufficient means neglects or refuses to maintain it. It is suggested that unless the child is admitted by the putative father to be his illegitimate child, the magistrate has no power to make an order for payment of maintenance. This argument, if accepted, would make the entire section nugatory. The basis of an application for maintenance of a child is the paternity of the child irrespective of its legitimacy or illegitimacy. The section by conferring jurisdiction on the magistrate to make an allowance for the maintenance of the child, by necessary implication, confers power on him to decide the jurisdictional fact whether the child is the illegitimate child of the respondent. It is the duty of the court, before making the order, to find definitely, though in a summary manner, the paternity of the child. Sub-section (6) of section 488 is mandatory in form and in clear terms it prescribes the procedure to be followed by the Magistrate. Under that subsection, all evidence under that Chapter shall be taken in the presence of the husband or the father, as the case maybe, or, when his personal attendance is dispensed with, in the presence of his pleader, and shall be recorded in the manner prescribed in the case of summons-cases. The word \" all \" with which the sub-section opens emphasizes the fact that no evidence shall be taken in the absence of the father or his pleader. It is conceded that ss. 200 to 203 of the Code do not apply to an application under section 488 of the Code. As the proceedings are of a civil nature, the Code does not contemplate any preliminary enquiry. When the terms are clear, there is no scope for drawing inspiration from other sections of the Code, or for deviating from the procedure prescribed to fill up an alleged lacuna. It is said that if no preliminary enquiry be held, even in a blackmailing action notice will have to go to the respondent. There is nothing incongruous in this position; for, if a suit is filed in a civil court for a decree for maintenance by a child against the alleged putative father, summons will go to him without any preliminary enquiry. We are not impressed by the argument that the sub-section itself is intended only for the benefit of the respondent. It appears to us that notice to the respondent is in the interest of both the applicant as well as the respondent while it enables the respondent to be present when evidence is taken against him, it lightens the burdenof the petitioner, for an honest respondent may admit his paternity of the child, if that was a fact and may contest only the quantum of maintenance. We, therefore, hold that section 488 of the Code does not contemplate a preliminary enquiry before issuing a notice, but lays down that all evidence under that Chapter should be taken in the presence of the respondent or his pleader, indicating thereby that one enquiry only should be held after notice. The more objectionable feature in this case is that the Magistrate followed a procedure; which is, to say the least, unjust to the appellant. The appellant's guardian was examined by the Magistrate, and she related the circumstances that led to her illicit intimacy with the respondent; she has stated in what circumstance the intimacy commenced. She filed copies of the notices sent by her, through an advocate, by registered post to the respondent demanding maintenance and stated that she received the acknowledgments but the respondent did not think it fit to reply. She filed a photograph wherein she and the respondent were seated on chairs with the appellant standing between them. A servant was also examined, who deposed that she had seen the respondent visiting the appellant's mother at odd hours. This evidence, ordinarily, would be sufficient, even if the procedure followed by -the Magistrate was permissible, to give notice to the respondent. But the learned Magistrate cross-examined the mother of the appellant at great length. The cross- examination discloses that the Magistrate had either uncommon powers of intuition or extraneous sources of information, for he elicited so many minute details of her life that only an advocate well instructed in his brief could possibly do. The singularity of the method adopted by the Magistrate does not end there. The learned Magistrate, though he subsequently held that he could not make a preli- minary enquiry as contemplated by ss. 200 to 203 of the Code, examined the mother of the appellant at great length and then gave her opportunity under S. 202 of the Code to produce other evidence. After examining two more witnesses, the learned Magistrate ordered that \" no further evidence to be led at thisstage \". This order indicates that the learned Magistrate prevented the appellant at that stage to examine other witnesses. Even if a liberal meaning was given to the terms of the order, it would mean that at that time the Magistrate was inclined to give notice to the respondent but changed his mind subsequently. Thereafter, the Magistrate considered the evidence and delivered a judgment holding that the paternity of the appellant had not been established. While there was uncontradicted evidence sufficient for the Magistrate to give notice to the respondent, he recorded a finding against the appellant before the entire evidence was placed before him. While accepting the contention of the appellant that the procedure under ss. 200 to 203 of the Code did not apply, in fact he followed that procedure and converted the preliminary enquiry into a trial for the determination of the question raised. Indeed, he took upon himself the role of a cross- examining counsel engaged by the respondent. The record discloses that presumably the Magistrate was oppressed by the high status of the respondent, and instead of making a sincere attempt to ascertain the truth proceeded to adopt a procedure which is not warranted by the Code of Criminal Procedure, and to make an unjudicial approach to the case of the appellant. In the courts of law, there cannot be a double-standard-one for the highly placed and another for the rest: the Magistrate has no concern with personalities who are parties to the case before him but only with its merits. After carefully going through the entire record, we are satisfied that the appellant was not given full opportunity to establish his case in the manner prescribed by law. We should not be understood to have expressed any opinion on the merits of the case; they fall to be considered on the entire evidence which may be produced by the appellant in the presence of the respondent or his pleader, as the case may be. In the result, the order of the High Court is set aside and the reference made by the Sessions Judge is accepted and the 'application is remanded to the Court of the Magistrate, First Class, Allahabad, for disposal according to law.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DESAI,J.With a slight variation to suit the context Woolesey's prayer : \"had I served my God as reverently as I did my king, I would not have fallen on these days of penury\" is chanted by petitioners in this group of petitions in the Shellian tune : 'I fall onthe thorns of life I bleed.' Old age, ebbing mental and physical prowess, atrophy of both muscle and brain powers permeating these petitions, the petitioners in the fall of life yearn for equality of treatment which is being meted out to those who are soon going to join and swell their own ranks, Do pensioners entitled to receive superannuation or retiring pension under Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 ('1972 Rules' for short) form a class as a whole ? Is the date of retirement a relevant consideration for eligibility when a revised formula for computation of pension is ushered in and made effective from a specified date ? Would differential treatment to pensioners related to the date of retirement qua the revised formula for computation of pension attract Article 14 of the Constitution and the element of discrimination liable to be declared unconstitutional as being violative of article 14 ? These and the related questions debated in this group of petitions call for an answer in the backdrop of a welfare State and bearing in mind that pension is a socio-economic justice measure providing relief when advancing age gradually but irrevocably impairs capacity to stand on one's own feet. Factual matrix has little relevance to the issues raised and canvassed at the hearing. Petitioners 1 and 2 are retired pensioners of the Central Government, the first being a civil servant and the second being a member of the service personnel of the Armed Forces. The third petitioner is a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, formed to ventilate the legitimate public problems and consistent with its objective it is espousing the cause of the pensioners all over the country. Its locus standi is in question but that is a different matter. The first petitioner retired in 1972 and on computation, his pension worked out at Rupees 675 p.m. and along with the dearness relief granted from time to time, at the relevant time he was in receipt of monthly pension of Rupees 935. The second petitioner retired at or about that time and at the relevant time was in receipt of a pension plus dearness relief of Rupees 981 p.m. Union of India has been revising and liberalising the pension rules from time to time. Some landmark changes may be noticed. The First Central Pay Commission (1946-47) recommended that the age of retirement in future should be uniformly 58 years for all services and the scale of pension should be 1/80 of the emoluments for each year of service, subject to a limit of 35/80 witha ceiling of Rupees 8,000 per year for 35 years of service, which the Government of India while accepting the recommendation raised to Rupees 8,100 per year which would earn a monthly pension of Rupees 675 at the maximum. The Second Central Pay Commission (1957-58) re-affirmed that the age of superannuation should be 58 years for all classes of public servants but did not recommend any increase in the non- contributory retirement benefits and recommended that if in future any improvement is to be made, it was the considered view of the Commission that these benefits should be on a contributory basis. The Administrative Reforms Commission ('ARC' for short) set up by the Government of India in 1956 took note of the fact that the cost of living has shot up and correspondingly the possibility of savings has gone down and consequently the drop in wages on retirement is in reality much steeper than what the quantum of pension would indicate, and accordingly the ARC recommended that the quantum of pension admissible may be raised to 3/6 of the emoluments of the last three years of service as against the existing 3/8 and the ceiling should be raised from Rupees 675 p.m. to Rupees 1000 p.m. Before the Government could take its decision on the recommendations of the ARC, the Third Central Pay Commission was set up. One of the terms of reference of the Third Pay Commission was 'death-cum- retirement benefits of Central Government employees'. The Third Pay Commission did not examine the question of relief to pensioners because in its view unless the terms of reference were suitably amended it would not be within their jurisdiction to examine this question and on a reference by them, the Government of India decided not to amend the terms of reference. With regard to the future pensioners the Third Pay Commission while reiterating that the age of superannuation should continue to be 58 years further recommended that no change in the existing formula for computing pension is considered necessary. The only important recommendation worth noticing is that the Commission recommended that the existing ceiling of maximum pension should be raised from Rupees 675 to Rupees 1,000 p.m. and the maximum of the gratuity should be raised from Rupees 24,000 to Rupees 30,000. On May 25, 1979, Government of India, Ministry of Finance, issued Office Memorandum number F-19(3)-EV-79 whereby the formula for computation of pension was liberalised but made it applicable to Government servants who were in service on March 31, 1979 and retire from service on or after that date (specified date for short). The formula introduced a slab system for computation ofpension. This liberalised pension formula was applicable to employees governed by the 1972 Rules retiring on or after the specified date. The pension for the service personnel which will include Army, Navy and Air Force staff is governed by the relevant regulations. By the Memorandum of the Ministry of Defence bearing number B/40725/AG/PS4-C/1816/AD (Pension)/Services dated September 28, 1979, the liberalised pension formula introduced for the government servants governed by the 1972 rules was extended to the Armed Forces personnel subject to limitations set out in the memorandum with a condition that the new rules of pension would be effective from April 1, 1979, and may be applicable to all service officers who become/became non-effective on or after that date. (for short specified date). The chronology of events herein narrated would bring to surface the contentions raised in these petitions. The liberalised pension formula shall be applicable prospectively to those who retired on or after March 31, 1979 in case of government servants covered by 1972 Rules and in respect of defence personnel those who became/become non-effective on or after April 1, 1979. Consequently those who retired prior to the specified date would not be entitled to the benefits of the liberalised pension formula. Petitioners accordingly contend that this Court may consider the raison d'etre for payment of pension. If the Pension is paid for past satisfactory service rendered, and to avoid destitution in old age as well as a social welfare or socio-economic justice measure, the differential treatment for those retiring prior to a certain date and those retiring subsequently, the choice of the date being wholly arbitrary, would be according differential treatment to pensioners who form a class irrespective of the date of retirement and, therefore, would be violative of article 14. It was also contended that classification based on fortuitous circumstance of retirement before or subsequent to a date, fixing of which is not shown to be related to any rational principle, would be equally violative of article 14. Primary contention is that the pensioners of the Central Government form a class for purpose of pensionary benefits and there could not be mini-classification within the class designated as pensioners. The expression 'pensioner' is generally understood in contra-distinction to the one in service. Government servants in service, in other words, those who have not retired, are entitled tosalary and other allowances. Those who retire and are designated as 'pensioners' are entitled to receive pension under the relevant rules. Therefore, this would clearly indicate that those who render service and retire on superannuation or any other mode of retirement and are in receipt of pension are comprehended in the expression 'pensioners'. Is this class of pensioners further divisible for the purpose of 'entitlement' and 'payment' of pension into those who retired by certain date and those who retired after that date ? If date of retirement can be accepted as a valid criterion for classification, on retirement each individual government servant would form a class by himself because the date of retirement of each is correlated to his birth date and on attaining a certain age he had to retire. It is only after the recommendations of the Third Central Pay Commission were accepted by the Government of India that the retirement dates have been specified to be 12 in number being last day of each month in which the birth date of the individual government servant happens to fall. In other words, all government servants who retire correlated to birth date on attaining the age of superannuation in a given month shall not retire on that date but shall retire on the last day of the month. Now, if date of retirement is a valid criterion for classification, those who retire at the end of every month shall form a class by themselves. This is too microscopic a classification to be upheld for any valid purpose. Is it permissible or is it violative of article 14 ? The scope, content and meaning of Article 14 of the Constitution has been the subject-matter of intensive examination by this Court in a catena of decisions. It would, therefore, be merely adding to the length of this judgment to recapitulate all those decisions and it is better to avoid that exercise save and except referring to the latest decision on the subject in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India(1) from which the following observation may be extracted: \"...... what is the content and reach of the great equalising principle enunciated in this article ? There can be no doubt that it is a founding faith of the Constitution. It is indeed the pillar on which rests securely the foundation of our democratic republic. And, therefore, it must not be subjected to a narrow, pedantic or lexicographic approach. No attempt should be made to truncate its all-embracing scope and meaning for, to do so would be to violate its activist magnitude. Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be imprisoned within traditional and doctrinaire limits..... Article 14 strikes at arbitrariness in State action and ensures fairness and equality of treatment. The principle of reasonableness, which legally as well as philosophically, is an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness pervades Article 14 like a brooding omnipresence.\" The decisions clearly lay down that though article 14 forbids class legislation, it does not forbid reasonable classification for the purpose of legislation. In order, however, to pass the test of permissible classification, two conditions must be fulfilled, viz., (i) that the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from those that are left out of the group; and (ii) that differentia must have a rational relation to the objects sought to be achieved by the statute in question. (see Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Shri Justice S.R. Tendolkar & Others.(1) The classification may be founded on differential basis according to objects sought to be achieved but what is implicit in it is that there ought to be a nexus i.e., causal connection between the basis of classification and object of the statute under consideration. It is equally well settled by the decisions of this Court that article 14 condemns discrimination not only by a substantive law but also by a law of procedure. After an exhaustive review of almost all decisions bearing on the question of article 14, this Court speaking through Chandrachud, C.J. in Re. Special Courts Bill (2) restated the settled propositions which emerged from the judgments of this Court undoubtedly insofar as they were relevant to the decision on the points arising for consideration in that matter. Four of them are apt and relevant for the present purpose and may be extracted. They are: \"3. The constitutional command to the State to afford equal protection of its laws sets a goal not attainable by the invention and application of a precise formula. Therefore, classification need not be constituted by an exact or scientific exclusion or inclusion of persons or things. The Courts should not insist on delusive exactness or apply doctrinaire tests for determining the validity of classification in any given case. Classification is justified if it is not palpably arbitrary. 4. The principle underlying the guarantee of Article 14 is not that the same rules of law should be applicable to all persons within the Indian territory or that the same remedies should be made available to them irrespective of differences of circumstances. It only means that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike both in privileges conferred and liabilities imposed. Equal laws would have to be applied to all in the same situation, and there should be no discrimination between one person and another if as regards the subject matter of the legislation their position is substantially the same. 6. The law can make and set apart the classes according to the needs and exigencies of the society and as suggested by experience. It can recognise even degree of evil, but the classification should never be arbitrary, artificial or evasive. 7. The classification must not be arbitrary but must be rational, that is to say, it must not only be based on some qualities or characteristics which are to be found in all the persons grouped together and not in others who are left out but those qualities or characteristics must have a reasonable relation to the object of the legislation. In order to pass the test, two conditions must be fulfilled, namely, (1) that the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes those that are grouped together from others and (2) that differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act.\" The other facet of article 14 which must be remembered is that it eschews arbitrariness in any form. Article 14 has, therefore, notto be held identical with the doctrine of classification. As was noticed in Maneka Gandhi's case in the earliest stages of evolution of the Constitutional law, article 14 came to be identified with the doctrine of classification because the view taken was that article 14 forbids discrimination and there will be no discrimination where the classification making the differentia fulfils the aforementioned two conditions. However, in EP. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu(1), it was held that the basic principle which informs both articles 14 and 16 is equality and inhibition against discrimination. This Court further observed as under: \"From a positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. In fact, equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an act is arbitrary it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to political logic and constitutional law and is, therefore, violative of article 14, and if it affects any matter relating to public employment, it is also violative of article 16. Articles 14 and 16 strike at arbitrariness in State action and ensure fairness and equality of treatment. Justice Iyer has in his inimitable style dissected Art. 14 as under: \"The article has a pervasive processual potency and versatile quality, equalitarian in its soul and allergic to discriminatory diktats. Equality is the antithesis of arbitrariness and ex cathedra ipse dixit is the ally of demagogic authoritarianism. Only knight- errants of 'executive excesses'-if we may use current cliche-can fall in love with the Dame of despotism, legislative or administrative. If this Court gives in here it gives up the ghost. And so it that I insist on the dynamics of limitations on fundamental freedoms as implying the rule of law; be you ever so high, the law is above you.\"(2) Affirming and explaining this view, the Constitution Bench in Ajay Hasia etc. v. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & others etc. (3) held that it must, therefore, now be taken to be well settled that what Art.14 strikes at is arbitrariness because any action that is arbitrary must necessarily involve negation of equality. The Court made it explicit that where an act is arbitrary it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to political logic and constitutional law and is, therefore, violative of article 14. After a review of large number of decisions bearing on the subject, in Air India etc. etc. v. Nargesh Meerza & ORS etc etc. (1) the Court formulated propositions emerging from analysis and examination of earlier decisions. One such proposition held well established is that article 14 is certainly attracted where equals are treated differently without any reasonable basis. Thus the fundamental principle is that article 14 forbids class legislation but permits reasonable classification for the purpose of legislation which classification must satisfy the twin tests of classification being founded on an intelligible differntia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from those that are left out of the group and that differentia must have a rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved by the statute in question. As a corrolary to this well established proposition, the next question is, on whom the burden lies to affirmatively establish the rational principle on which the classification is founded correlated to the object sought to be achieved ? The thrust of article 14 is that the citizen is entitled to equality before law and equal protection of laws. In the very nature of things the society being composed of unequals a welfare state will have to strive by both executive and legislative action to help the less fortunate in the society to ameliorate their condition so that the social and economic inequality in the society may be bridged. This would necessitate a legislation applicable to a group of citizens otherwise unequal and amelioration of whose lot is the object of state affirmative action. In the absence of doctrine of classification such legislation is likely to flounder on the bed rock of equality enshrined in article 14. The court realistically appraising the social stratification and economic inequality and keeping in view the guidelines on which the State action must move as constitutionally laid down in part IV of the Constitution, evolved the doctrine of classification. The doctrine was evolved to sustain a legislation or State action designed to help weaker sections of the society or somesuch segments of the society in need of succor. Legislative and executive action may accordingly be sustained if it satisfies the twin tests of reasonable classification and the rational principle correlated to the object sought to be achieved. The State, therefore, would have to affirmatively satisfy the Court that the twin tests have been satisfied. It can only be satisfied if the State establishes not only the rational principle on which classification is founded but correlate it to the objects sought to be achieved. This approach is noticed in Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. The International Airport Authority of India & ORS (1) when at page 1034, the Court observed that a discriminatory action of the Government is liable to be struck down, unless it can be shown by the Government that the departure was not arbitrary, but was based on some valid principle which in itself was not irrational, unreasonable or discriminatory. The basic contention as hereinbefore noticed is that the pensioners for the purpose of receiving pension form a class and there is no criterion on which classification of pensioners retiring prior to specified date and retiring subsequent to that date can provide a rational principle correlated to object, viz., object underlying payment of pensions. In reply to this contention set out in para 19 of the petition, Mr. S.N. Mathur, Director, Ministry of Finance in part 17 of his affidavit-in-opposition on behalf of the respondents has averred as under:\"The contentions in part 18 and 19 that all pensioners form one class is not correct and the petitioners have not shown how they form one class. Classification of pensioners on the basis of their date of retirement is a valid classification for the purpose of pensionary benefits.\" These averments would show at a glance that the State action is sought to be sustained on the doctrine of classification and the criterion on which the classification is sought to be sustained is the date of retirement of the Government servant which entitled him to pension. Thus according to the respondents, pensioners who retire from Central Government service and are governed by the relevant pension rules all do not form a class but pensioners who retire prior to a certain date and those who retire subsequent to a certain date form distinct and separate classes. It may be made clear that the date of retirement of each individualpensioner is not suggested as a criterion for classification as that would lead to an absurd result, because in that event every pensioner relevant to his date of retirement will form a class unto himself. What is suggested is that when a pension scheme undergoes a revision and is enforced effective form a certain date, the date so specified becomes a sort of a Rubicon and those who retire prior to that date form one class and those who retire on a subsequent date form a distinct and separate class and no one can cross the Rubicon. And the learned Attorney General contended that this differentiation is grounded on a rational principle and it has a direct correlation to the object sought to be achieved by liberalised pension formula. The approach of the respondents raises a vital and none too easy of answer, question as to why pension is paid. And why was it required to be liberalised ? Is the employer, which expression will include even the State, bound to pay pension ? Is there any obligation on the employer to provide for the erstwhile employee even after the contract of employment has come to an end and the employee has ceased to render service ? What is a pension ? What are the goals of pension ? What public interest or purpose, if any, it seeks to serve ? If it does seek to serve some public purpose, is it thwarted by such artificial division of retirement pre and post a certain date ? We need seek answer to these and incidental questions so as to render just justice between parties to this petition. The antiquated notion of pension being a bounty a gratituous payment depending upon the sweet will or grace of the employer not claimable as a right and, therefore, no right to pension can be enforced through Court has been swept under the carpet by the decision of the Constitution Bench in Deoki Nandan Prasad v. State of Bihar & ORS (1) wherein this Court authoritatively ruled that pension is a right and the payment of it does not depend upon the discretion of the Government but is governed by the rules and a Government servant coming within those rules is entitled to claim pension. It was further held that the grant of pension does not depend upon any one's discretion. It is only for the purpose ofquantifying the amount having regard to service and other allied matters that it may be necessary for the authority to pass an order to that effect but the right to receive pension flows to the officer not because of any such order but by virtue of the rules. This view was reaffirmed in State of Punjab & ANR v. Iqbal Singh (1). There are various kinds of pensions and there are equally various methods of funding pension programmes. The present enquiry is limited to non-contributory superannuation or retirement pension paid by Government to its erstwhile employee and the purpose and object underlying it. Initially this class of pension appears to have been introduced as a reward for loyal service. Probably the alien rulers who recruited employees in lower echelons of service from the colony and exported higher level employees from the seat of Empire, wanted to ensure in the case of former continued loyalty till death to the alien rulers and in the case of latter, an assured decent living standard in old age ensuring economic security at the cost of the colony. In the course of transformation of society from feudal to welfare and as socialistic thinking acquired respectability, State obligation to provide security in old age, an escape from undeserved want was recognised and as a first step pension was treated not only as a reward for past service but with a view to helping the employee to avoid destitution in old age. The quid pro quo, was that when the employee was physically and mentally alert he rendered unto master the best, expecting him to look after him in the fall of life. A retirement system therefore exists solely for the purpose of providing benefits. In most of the plans of retirement benefits, everyone who qualifies for normal retirement receives the same amount. (see Retirement Systems for Public Employees by Bleakney, page 33.) As the present case is concerned with superannuation pension, a brief history of its initial introduction in early stages and continued existence till today may be illuminating. Superannuation is the most descriptive word of all but has become obsolescent because it seems ponderous. Its genesis can be traced to the first Act of Parliament (in U.K.) to be concerned with the provision of pensions generally in public offices. It was passed in 1810. TheAct which substantively devoted itself exclusively to the problem of superannuation pension was superannuation Act of 1834. These are landmarks in pension history because they attempted for the first time to establish a comprehensive and uniform scheme for all whom we may now call civil servants. Even before the 19th century, the problem of providing for public servants who are unable, through old age or incapacity, to continue working, has been recognised, but methods of dealing with the problem varied from society to society and even occasionally from department to department. A political society which has a goal of setting up of a welfare State, would introduce and has in fact introduced as a welfare measure wherein the retiral benefit is grounded on 'considerations of State obligation to its citizens who having rendered service during the useful span of life must not be left to penury in their old age, but the evolving concept of social security is a later day development'. And this journey was over a rough terrain. To note only one stage in 1856 a Royal Commission was set up to consider whether any changes were necessary in the system established by the 1834 Act. The Report of the Commission is known as \"Northcote-Trevelyan Report\". The Report was pungent in its criticism when it says that: \"in civil services comparable to lightness of work and the certainty of provision in case of retirement owing to bodily incapacity, furnish strong inducements to the parents and friends of sickly youths to endeavour to obtain for them employment in the service of the Government, and the extent to which the public are consequently burdened; first with the salaries of officers who are obliged to absent themselves from their duties on account of ill health, and afterwards with their pensions when they retire on the same plea, would hardly be credited by those who have not had opportunities of observing the operation of the system\" (see Gerald Rhodes, Public Sector Pensions, pp. 18-19). This approach is utterly unfair because in modern times public services are manned by those who enter at a comparatively very young age, with selection through national competitive examination and ordinarily the best talent gets the opportunity. Let us therefore examine what are the goals that pension scheme seeks to subserve ? A pension scheme consistent with available resources must provide that the pensioner would be able to live: (i) free from want, with decency, independence and self-respect,and (ii) at a standard equivalent at the pre-retirement level. This approach may merit the criticism that if a developing country like India cannot provide an employee while rendering service a living wage, how can one be assured of it in retirement ? This can be aptly illustrated by a small illustration. A man with a broken arm asked his doctor whether he will be able to play the piano after the cast is removed. When assured that he will, the patient replied, 'that is funny, I could not before'. It appears that determining the minimum amount required for living decently is difficult, selecting the percentage representing the proper ratio between earnings and the retirement income is harder. But it is imperative to note that as self- sufficiency declines the need for his attendance or institutional care grows. Many are literally surviving now than in the past. We owe it to them and ourselves that they live, not merely exist. The philosophy prevailing in a given society at various stages of its development profoundly influences its social objectives. These objectives are in turn a determinant of a social policy. The law is one of the chief instruments whereby the social policies are implemented and 'pension is paid according to rules which can be said to provide social security law by which it is meant those legal mechanisms primarily concerned to ensure the provision for the individual of a cash income adequate, when taken along with the benefits in kind provided by other social services (such as free medical aid) to ensure for him a culturally acceptable minimum standard of living when the normal means of doing so failed'. (see Social Security law by Prof. Harry Calvert, p. 1). Viewed in the light of the present day notions pension is a term applied to periodic money payments to a person who retires at a certain age considered age of disability; payments usually continue for the rest of the natural life of the recipient. The reasons underlying the grant of pension vary from country to country and from scheme to scheme. But broadly stated they are (i) as compensation to former members of the armed forces or their dependents for old age, disability, or death (usually from service causes), (ii) as old age retirement or disability benefits for civilian employees, and (iii) as social security payments for the aged, disabled, or deceased citizens made in accordance with the rules governing social service programmes of the country. Pensions under the first head are of great antiquity. Under the second head they have been in force in one form or another in some countries for over a century but those coming under the third head are relatively of recent origin, though they are of the greatestmagnitude. There are other views about pensions such as charity, paternalism, deferred pay, rewards for service rendered, or as a means or promoting general welfare (see Encyclopaedia Britannica, Vol. 17 p.575.) But these views have become otiose. Pension to civil employees of the Government and the defence personnel as administered in India appear to be a compensation for service rendered in the past. However, as held in Douge v. Board of Education(1) a pension is closely akin to wages in that it consists of payment provided by an employer, is paid in consideration of past service and serves the purpose of helping the recipient meet the expenses of living. This appears to be the nearest to our approach to pension with the added qualification that it should ordinarily ensure freedom from undeserved want. Summing-up it can be said with confidence that pension is not only compensation for loyal service rendered in the past, but pension also has a broader significance, in that it is a measure of socio-economic justice which inheres economic security in the fall of life when physical and mental prowess is ebbing corresponding to aging process and therefore, one is required to fall back on savings. One such saving in kind is when you gave your best in the hey-day of life to your employer, in days of invalidity, economic security by way of periodical payment is assured. The term has been judicially defined as a stated allowance or stipend made in consideration of past service or a surrender of rights or emoluments to one retired from service. Thus the pension payable to a Government employee is earned by rendering long and efficient service and therefore can be said to be a deferred portion of the compensation or for service rendered. In one sentence one can say that the most practical raison d'etre for pension is the inability to provide for oneself due to old age. One may live and avoid unemployment but not senility and penury if there is nothing to fall back upon. The discernible purpose thus underlying pension scheme or a statute introducing the pension scheme must inform interpretative process and accordingly it should receive a liberal construction and the courts may not so interpret such statute as to render them inane (see American Jurisprudence 2d. 881). From the discussion three things emerge : (i) that pension is neither a bounty nor a matter of grace depending upon the sweet will of the employer and that it creates a vested right subject to 1972 rules which are statutory in character because they are enacted in exercise of powers conferred by the proviso to article 309 and clause (5) of Art. 148 of the Constitution ; (ii) that the pension is not an ex-gratia payment but it is a payment for the past service rendered ; and (iii) it is a social welfare measure rendering socio-economic justice to those who in the hey-day of their life ceaselessly toiled for the employer on an assurance that in their old age they would not be left in lurch. It must also be noticed that the quantum of pension is a certain percentage correlated to the average emoluments drawn during last three years of service reduced to ten months under liberalised pension scheme. Its payment is dependent upon an additional condition of impeccable behaviour even subsequent to requirement, that is, since the cessation of the contract of service and that it can be reduced or withdrawn as a disciplinary measure. Having succinctly focussed our attention on the conspectus of elements and incidents of pension the main question may now be tackled. But, the approach of court while considering such measure is of paramount importance. Since the advent of the Constitution, the state action must be directed towards attaining the goals set out in Part IV of the Constitution which, when achieved, would permit us to claim that we have set up a welfare State. Article 38 (1) enjoins the State to strive to promote welfare of the people by securing and protecting as effective as it may a social order in which justice social, economic and political shall inform all institutions of the national life. In particular the State shall strive to minimise the inequalities in income and endeavour to eliminate inequalities in status, facilities and opportunities. article 39 (d) enjoins a duty to see that there is equal pay for equal work for both men and women and this directive should be understood and interpreted in the light of the judgment of this Court in Randhir Singh v. Union of India & ORS (1) Revealing the scope and content of this facet of equality, Chinnappa Reddy, J. speaking for the Court observed as under : \"Now, thanks to the rising social and political consciousness and the expectations aroused as a consequence and the forward looking posture of this Court, the under- privileged also are clamouring for the rights and are seeking the intervention of the Court with touching faith and confidence in the Court. The Judges of the Court have a duty to redeem their Constitutional oath and do justice no less to the pavement dweller than to the guest of the Five Star Hotel.\" Proceeding further, this Court observed that where all relevant considerations are the same, persons holding identical posts may not be treated differently in the matter of their pay merely because they belong to different departments. If that can't be done when they are in service, can that be done during their retirement? Expanding this principle, one can confidently say that if pensioners form a class, their computation cannot be by different formula affording unequal treatment solely on the ground that some retired earlier and some retired later. article 39 (e) requires the State to secure that the health and strength of workers, men and women, and children of tender age are not abused and that citizens are not forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their age or strength. article 41 obligates the State within the limits of its economic capacity and development, to make effective provision for securing the right to work, to education and to provide assistance in cases of unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement, and in other cases of undeserved want. article 43 (3) requires the State to endeavour to secure amongst other things full enjoyment of leisure and social and cultural opportunities. Recall at this stage the Preamble, the flood light illuminating the path to be pursued by the State to set up a Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic. Expression 'socialist' was intentionally introduced in the Preamble by the Constitution (Forty-Second Amendment) Act, 1976. In the objects and reasons for amendment amongst other things, ushering in of socio-economic revolution was promised. The clarion call may be extracted : \"The question of amending the Constitution for removing the difficulties which have arisen in achieving the objective of socio-economic revolution, which would end poverty and ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity, has been engaging the active attention of Government and the public for some time......... It is, therefore, proposed to amend the Constitution to spell out expressly the high ideals of socialism........to make the directive principles more comprehensive......\" What does a Socialist Republic imply? Socialism is a much misunderstood word. Values determine contemporary socialism pure and simple. But it is not necessary at this stage to go into all its ramifications. The principal aim of a socialist State is to eliminate inequality in income and status and standards of life. The basic framework of socialism is to provide a decent standard of life to the working people and especially provide security from cradle to grave. This amongst others on economic side envisaged economic equality and equitable distribution of income. This is a blend of Marxism and Gandhism leaning heavily towards Gandhian socialism. During the formative years, socialism aims at providing all opportunities for pursuing the educational activity. For want of wherewithal or financial equipment the opportunity to be fully educated shall not be denied. Ordinarily, therefore, a socialist State provides for free education from primary to Ph. D. but the pursuit must be by those who have the necessary intelligence quotient and not as in our society where a brainy young man coming from a poor family will not be able to prosecute the education for want of wherewithal while the ill-equipped son or daughter of a well-to-do father will enter the portals of higher education and contribute to national wastage. After the education is completed, socialism aims at equality in pursuit of excellence in the chosen avocation without let or hindrance of caste, colour, sex or religion and with full opportunity to reach the top not thwarted by any considerations of status, social or otherwise. But even here the less equipped person shall be assured a decent minimum standard of life and exploitation in any form shall be eschewed. There will be equitable distribution of national cake and the worst off shall be treated in such a manner as to push them up the ladder. Then comes the old age in the life of everyone, be he a monarch or a Mahatma, a worker or a pariah. The old age overtakes each one, death being the fulfilment of life providing freedom from bondage. But there socialism aims at providing an economic security to those who have rendered unto society what they were capable of doing when they were fully equipped with their mental and physical prowess. In the fall of life the State shall ensure to the citizens a reasonably decent standard of life, medical aid, freedom from want, freedom from fear and the enjoyable leisure,relieving the boredom and the humility of dependence in old age. This is what article 41 aims when it enjoins the State to secure public assistance in old age, sickness and disablement. It was such a socialist State which the Preamble directs the centres of power Legislative Executive and Judiciary-to strive to set up. From a wholly feudal exploited slave society to a vibrant, throbbing socialist welfare society is a long march but during this journey to the fulfilment of goal every State action whenever taken must be directed, and must be so interpreted, as to take the society one step towards the goal. To some extent this approach will find support in the judgment in Minerva Mills Ltd. & ORS v. Union of India & ORS (1). Speaking for the majority, Chandrachud, C.J. observed as under : \"This is not mere semantics. The edifice of our Constitution is built upon the concepts crystallised in the Preamble. We resolved to constitute ourselves into a Socialist State which carried with it the obligation to secure to our people justice-social, economic and political.We, therefore, put Part IV into our Constitution containing directive principles of State policy which specify the socialistic goal to be achieved.\" At a later stage it was observed that the fundamental rights are not an end in themselves but are the means to an end, the end is specified in part IV. Bhagwati, J. in his minority judgment after extracting a portion of the speech of the then Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru, while participating in a discussion on the Constitution (First Amendment) Bill, observed that the Directive Principles are intended to bring about a socio-economic revolution and to create a new socio-economic order where there will be social and economic justice for all and everyone, not only a fortunate few but the teeming millions of India, would be able to participate in the fruits of freedom and development and exercise the fundamental rights. It, therefore, appears to be well established that while interpreting or examining the constitutional validity of legislative/administrative action, the touchstone of Directive Principles of State Policy in the light of the Preamble will provide a reliable yardstick to hold one way or the other. With this background let us now turn to the challenge posed in these petitions. The challenge is not to the validity of the pension liberalisation scheme. The scheme is wholly acceptable to the petitioners, nay they are ardent supporters of it, nay further they seek the benefit of it. The petitioners challenge only that part of the scheme by which its benefits are admissible to those who retired from service after a certain date. In other words, they challenge that the scheme must be uniformly enforced with regard to all pensioners for the purpose of computation of pension irrespective of the date when the Government servant retired subject to the only condition that he was governed by the 1972 Rules. No doubt, the benefit of the scheme will be available from the specified date, irrespective of the fact when the concerned Government servant actually retired from service. Having set out clearly the society which we propose to set up, the direction in which the State action must move, the welfare State which we propose to build up, the constitutional goal of setting up a socialist State and the assurance in the Directive Principles of State Policy especially of security in old age at least to those who have rendered useful service during their active years, it is indisputable, nor was it questioned, that pension as a retirement benefit is in consonance with and furtherance of the goals of the Constitution. The goals for which pension is paid themselves give a fillip and push to the policy of setting up a welfare State because by pension the socialist goal of security of cradle to grave is assured at least when it is mostly needed and least available, namely, in the fall of life. If such be the goals of pension, if such be the welfare State which we propose to set up, if such be the goals of socialism and conceding that any welfare measure may consistent with economic capacity of the State be progressively augmented with wider width and a longer canvass yet when the economic means permit the augmentation, should some be left out for the sole reason that while in the formative years of the nascent State they contributed their mite but when the fruits of their labour led to the flowering of economic development and higher gross national produce bringing in larger revenue and therefore larger cake is available, they would be denied any share of it ? Indisputably, viewed from any angle pensioners for payment of pension form a class. Unquestionably pension is linked to length of service and the last pay drawn but the last pay does not imply the pay on the last day of retirementbut average emoluments as defined in the scheme. Earlier average emoluments of 36 months' service provided the measure of pension because the pension was related to the average emoluments during 36 months just preceding retirement. By the liberalised scheme it is now reduced to average emoluments of 10 months preceding the date. Any one in government service would appreciate at a glance that with an average of 10 months it would be on the higher side on account of the two fortuitous circumstances that the pay- scales, if one has not reached the maximum, permit annual increments and there are promotions in the last one or two years. With a view to giving a higher average the scheme was liberalised to provide for average emoluments with reference to last 10 months' service. Coupled with it, a slab system for computation is introduced and the ceiling is raised. This is liberalisation. Now, if the pensioners who retired prior to the specified date and had to earn pension on the average emoluments of 36 months' salary just preceding the date of retirement, naturally the average would be lower and they will be doubly hit because the slab system as now introduced was not available and the ceiling was at a lower level. Thus they suffer triple jeopardy, viz., lower average emoluments, absence of slab system and lower ceiling. What then is the purpose in prescribing the specified date vertically dividing the pensioners between those who retired prior to the specified date and those who retire subsequent to that date? That poses the further question, why was the pension scheme liberalised ? What necessitated liberalisation of the pension scheme ? Both the impugned memoranda do not spell out the raison d'etre for liberalising the pension formula. In the affidavit in opposition by Shri S.N. Mathur, it has been stated that the liberalisation of pension of retiring Government servants was decided by the Government in view of the persistent demand of the Central Government employees represented in the scheme of Joint Consultative Machinery. This would clearly imply that the preliberalised pension scheme did not provide adequate protection in old age and that a further liberalisation was necessary as a measure of economic security. When Government favourably responded to the demand it thereby ipso facto conceded that there was a larger available national cake part of which could be utilised for providing higher security to erstwhile government servants who would retire. The Government also took note of thefact that continuous upward movement of the cost of living index as a sequel of inflationary inputs and diminishing purchasing power of rupee necessitated upward revision of pension. If this be the underlying intendment of liberalisation of pension scheme, can any one be bold enough to assert that it was good enough only for those who would retire subsequent to the specified date but those who had already retired did not suffer the pangs of rising prices and falling purchasing power of the rupee ? What is the sum total of picture ? Earlier the scheme was not that liberal keeping in view the definition of average emoluments and the absence of slab system and a lower ceiling. Those who rendered the same service earned less pension and are exposed to the vagary of rising prices consequent upon the inflationary inputs. If therefore, those who are to retire subsequent to the specified date would feel the pangs in their old age, of lack of adequate security, by what stretch of imagination the same can be denied to those who retired earlier with lower emoluments and yet are exposed to the vagaries of the rising prices and the falling purchasing power of the rupee. And the greater misfortune is that they are becoming older and older compared to those who would be retiring subsequent to the specified date. The Government was perfectly justified in liberalising the pension scheme. In fact it was overdue. But we find no justification for arbitrarily selecting the criteria for eligibility for the benefits of the scheme dividing the pensioners all of whom would be retirees but falling on one or the other side of the specified date. Therefore, let us proceed to examine whether there was any rationale behind the eligibility qualification. The learned Attorney-General contended that the scheme is one whole and that the date is an integral part of the scheme and the Government would have never enforced the scheme devoid of the date and the date is not severable from the scheme as a whole. Contended the learned Attorney-General that the Court does not take upon itself the function of legislation for persons, things or situations omitted by the legislature. It was said that when the legislature has expressly defined the class with clarity and precision to which the legislation applies, it would be outside the judicial function to enlarge the class and to do so is not to interpret but to legislate which is the forbidden field. Alternatively it was also contended that where a larger class comprising two smaller classes is covered by a legislation of which one part is constitutional, the Court examines whetherthe legislation must be invalidated as a whole or only in respect of the unconstitutional part. It was also said that severance always cuts down the scope of legislation but can never enlarge it and in the present case the scheme as it stands would not cover pensioners such as the petitioners and if by severance an attempt is made to include them in the scheme it is not cutting down the class or the scope but enlarge the ambit of the scheme which is impermissible even under the doctrine of severability. In this context it was lastly submitted that there is not a single case in India or elsewhere where the Court has included some category within the scope of provisions of a law to maintain its constitutionality. The last submission, the absence of precedent need not deter us for a moment. Every new norm of socio economic justice, every new measure of social justice commenced for the first time at some point of history. If at that time it is rejected as being without a precedent, the law as an instrument of social engineering would have long since been dead and no tears would have been shed. To be pragmatic is not to be unconstitutional. In its onward march law as an institution ushers in socio-economic justice. In fact, social security in old age commended itself in earlier stages as a moral concept but in course of time it acquired legal contention. The rules of natural justice owed their origin to ethical and moral code. Is there any doubt that they have become the integral and inseparable parts of rule of law of which any civilised society is proud ? Can anyone be bold enough to assert that ethics and morality are outside the field of legal formulations ? Socio-economic justice stems from the concept of social morality coupled with abhorrence for economic exploitation. And the advancing society converts in course of time moral or ethical code into enforceable legal formulations. Over-emphasis on precedent furnishes an insurmountable road-block to the onward march towards promised millennium. An overdose of precedents is the bane of our system which is slowly getting stagnant, stratified and atrophied. Therefore absence of a precedent on this point need not deter us at all. We are all the more happy for the chance of scribbling on a clean slate. If it appears to be undisputable, as it does to us that the pensioners for the purpose of pension benefits form a class, would its upward revision permit a homogeneous class to be divided by arbitrarily fixing an eligibility criteria unrelated to purpose of revision, and would such classification be founded on some rationalprinciple ? The classification has to be based, as is well settled, on some rational principle and the rational principle must have nexus to the objects sought to be achieved. We have set out the objects underlying the payment of pension. If the State considered it necessary to liberalise the pension scheme, we find no rational principle behind it for granting these benefits only to those who retired subsequent to that date simultaneously denying the same to those who retired prior to that date. If the liberalisation was considered necessary for augmenting social security in old age to government servants then those who retired earlier cannot be worst off than those who retire later. Therefore, this division which classified pensioners into two classes is not based on any rational principle and if the rational principle is the one of dividing pensioners with a view to giving something more to persons otherwise equally placed, it would be discriminatory. To illustrate, take two persons, one retired just a day prior and another a day just succeeding the specified date. Both were in the same pay bracket, the average emolument was the same and both had put in equal number of years of service. How does a fortuitous circumstance of retiring a day earlier or a day later will permit totally unequal treatment in the matter of pension ? One retiring a day earlier will have to be subject to ceiling of Rupees 8,100 p a. and average emolument to be worked out on 36 months' salary while the other will have a ceiling of Rupees 12,000 p.a. and average emolument will be computed on the basis of last ten months average. The artificial division stares into face and is unrelated to any principle and whatever principle, if there be any, has absolutely no nexus to the objects sought to be achieved by liberalising the pension scheme. In fact this arbitrary division has not only no nexus to the liberalised pension scheme but it is counter productive and runs counter to the whole gamut of pension scheme. The equal treatment guaranteed in article 14 is wholly violated inasmuch as the pension rules being statutory in character, since the specified date, the rules accord differential and discriminatory treatment to equals in the matter of commutation of pension. A 48 hours difference in matter of retirement would have a traumatic effect. Division is thus both arbitrary and unprincipled. Therefore the classification does not stand the test of Art. 14. Further the classification is wholly arbitrary because we do not find a single acceptable or persuasive reason for this division. This arbitrary action violated the guarantee of article 14. The next question is what is the way you ? The learned Attorney-General contended that the scheme is to be taken as a whole or rejected as a whole and the date from which it came into force is an integral and inseparable part of the scheme. The two sub-limbs of the submissions were that, (i) the Court cannot make a scheme having financial implications retroactive, and (ii) this Court cannot grant any relief to the pensioners who retired prior to a specified date because if more persons divide the available cake, the residue falling to the share of each especially to those who are likely to be benefited by the scheme will be comparatively smaller and as they are not before the Court, no relief can be given to the pensioners. Let us clear one misconception. The pension scheme including the liberalised scheme available to the Government employees is non-contributory in character. It was not pointed out that there is something like a pension fund. It is recognised as an item of expenditure and it is budgeted and voted every year. At any given point of time there is no fixed or predetermined pension fund which is divided amongst eligible pensioners. There is no artificially created fund or reservoir from which pensioners draw pension within the limits of the fund, the share of each being extensive with the available fund. The payment of pension is a statutory liability undertaken by the Government and whatever becomes due and payable is budgeted for. One could have appreciated this line of reasoning where there is a contributory scheme and a pension fund from which alone pension is disbursed. That being not the case, there is no question of pensioners dividing the pension fund which, if more persons are admitted to the scheme, would pro rata affect the share. Therefore, there is no question of dividing the pension fund. Pension is a liability incurred and has to be provided for in the budget. Therefore, the argument of divisions of a cake, larger the number of sharers, smaller the share and absence of residue and therefore by augmentation of beneficiaries, pro rata share is likely to be affected and their absence making relief impermissible, is an argument born of desperation, and is without merits and must be rejected as untenable. By our approach, are we making the scheme retroactive ? The answer is emphatically in the negative. Take a government servant who retired on April 1, 1979. He would be governed by the liberalised pension scheme. By that time he had put in qualifying service of 35 years. His length of service is a relevant factor for computation of pension. Has the Government made it retroactive, 35 years backward compared to the case of a Government servant who retired on 30th March, 1979 ? Concept of qualifying service takes note of length of service, and pension quantum is correlated to qualifying service. Is it retroactive for 35 years for one and not retroactive for a person who retired two days earlier ? It must be remembered that pension is relatable to qualifying service. It has correlation to the average emoluments and the length of service. Any liberalisation would pro tanto be retroactive in the narrow sense of the term. Otherwise it is always prospective. A statute is not properly called a retroactive statute because a part of the requisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing. (see Craies on Statute Law, sixth edition, p. 387). Assuming the Government had not prescribed the specified date and thereby provided that those retiring pre and post the specified date would all be governed by the liberalised pension scheme, undoubtedly, it would be both prospective and retroactive. Only the pension will have to be recomputed in the light of the formula enacted in the liberalised pension scheme and effective from the date the revised scheme comes into force. And beware that it is not a new scheme, it is only a revision of existing scheme. It is not a new retiral benefit. It is an upward revision of an existing benefit. If it was a wholly new concept, a new retiral benefit, one could have appreciated an argument that those who had already retired could not expect it. It could have been urged that it is an incentive to attract the fresh recruits. Pension is a reward for past service. It is undoubtedly a condition of service but not an incentive to attract new entrants because if it was to be available to new entrants only, it would be prospective at such distance of thirty-five years since its introduction. But it covers all those in service who entered thirty-five years back. Pension is thus not an incentive but a reward for past service. And a revision of an existing benefit stands on a different footing than a new retiral benefit. And even in case of new retiral benefit of gratuity under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 past service was taken into consideration. Recall at this stage the method adopted when pay-scales are revised. Revised pay-scales are introduced from a certain date. All existing employees are brought on to the revised scales by adopting a theory of fitments and increments for past service. In other words, benefit of revised scale is not limited to those who enter service subsequent to the date fixed for introducing revised scales but the benefit is extended to all those in service prior to that date. This is just and fair. Nowif pension as we view it, is some kind of retirement wages for past service, can it be denied to those who retired earlier, revised retirement benefits being available to future retirees only ? Therefore, there is no substance in the contention that the court by its approach would be making the scheme retroactive, because it is implicit in theory of wages. That takes us to the last important contention of the learned Attorney General. It was urged that the date from which the scheme becomes operative is an integral part of the scheme and the doctrine of severability cannot be invoked. In other words, it was urged that date cannot be severed from the main object of the scheme because the Government would have never offered the scheme unless the date was an integral part of it. Undoubtedly when an upward revision is introduced, a date from which it becomes effective has to be provided. It is the event of retirement subsequent to the specified date which introduces discrimination in one otherwise homogeneous class of pensioners. This arbitrary selection of the happening of event subsequent to specified date denies equality of treatment to persons belonging to the same class, some preferred and some omitted. Is this eligibility qualification severable ? It was very seriously contended, remove the event correlated to date and examine whether the scheme is workable. We find no difficulty in implementing the scheme omitting the event happening after the specified date retaining the more humane formula for computation of pension. It would apply to all existing pensioners and future pensioners. In the case of existing pensioners, the pension will have to be recomputed by applying the rule of average emoluments as set out in Rule 34 and introducing the slab system and the amount worked out within the floor and the ceiling. But we make it abundantly clear that arrears are not required to be made because to that extent the scheme is prospective.All pensioners whenever they retired would be covered by the liberalised pension scheme, because the scheme is a scheme for payment of pension to a pensioner governed by 1972 Rules. The date of retirement is irrelevant. But the revised scheme would be operative from the date mentioned in the scheme and would bring under its umbrella all existing pensioners and those who retired subsequent to that date. In case of pensioners who retired prior to the specified date, their pension would be computed afresh andwould be payable in future commencing from the specified date. No arrears would be payable. And that would take care of the grievance of retrospectivity. In our opinion, it would make a marginal difference in the case of past pensioners because the emoluments are not revised. The last revision of emoluments was as per the recommendation of the Third Pay commission (Raghubar Dayal Commission). If the emoluments remain the same, the computation of average emoluments under amended Rule 34 may raise the average emoluments, the period for averaging being reduced from last 36 months to last 10 months. The slab will provide slightly higher pension and if someone reaches the maximum the old lower ceiling will not deny him what is otherwise justly due on computation. The words \"who were in service on 31st March, 1979 and retiring from service on or after the date\" excluding the date for commencement of revision are words of limitation introducing the mischief and are vulnerable as denying equality and introducing an arbitrary fortuitous circumstance can be severed without impairing the formula. Therefore, there is absolutely no difficulty in removing the arbitrary and discriminatory portion of the scheme and it can be easily severed. There is nothing immutable about the choosing of an event as an eligibility criteria subsequent to a specified date. If the event is certain but its occurrence at a point of time is considered wholly irrelevant and arbitrarily selected having no rationale for selecting it and having an undesirable effect of dividing homogeneous class and of introducing the discrimination, the same can be easily severed and set aside. While examining the case under Art. 14, the approach is not: 'either take it or leave it', the approach is removal of arbitrariness and if that can be brought about by severing the mischievous portion the court ought to remove the discriminatory part retaining the beneficial portion. The pensioners do not challenge the liberalised pension scheme. They seek the benefit of it. Their grievance is of the denial to them of the same by arbitrary introduction of words of limitation and we find no difficulty in severing and quashing the same. This approach can be legitimised on the ground that every Government servant retires. State grants upward revision of pension undoubtedly from a date. Event has occurred revision has been earned. Date is merely to avoid payment of arrears which may impose a heavy burden. If the date is wholly removed, revised pensions will have to be paid from the actual date of retirement of each pensioner. That is impermissible. The Statecannot be burdened with arrears commencing from the date of retirement of each pensioner. But effective from the specified date future pension of earlier retired Government servants can be computed and paid on the analogy of fitments in revised pay-scales becoming prospectively operative. That removes the nefarious unconstitutional part and retains the beneficial portion. It does not adversely affect future pensioners and their presence in the petitions becomes irrelevant. But before we do so, we must look into the reasons assigned for eligibility criteria, namely, 'in service on the specified date and retiring after that date'. The only reason we could find in affidavit of Shri Mathur is the following statement in paragraph 5 : \"The date of effect of the impugned orders has been selected on the basis of relevant and valid considerations.\" We repeatedly posed a question: what are those relevant and valid considerations and waited for the answer in vain. We say so because in the written submissions filed on behalf of the Union of India, we find not a single valid or relevant consideration much less any consideration relevant to selection of eligibility criteria. The tenor is \"we select the date and it is unquestionable; either take it or leave it as a whole\". The only submission was that the date is not severable and some submissions in support of it. Having examined the matter on principle, let us turn to some precedents. In D.R. Nim v. Union of India(1) the appellant questioned his seniority which was to be determined in accordance with the provisions contained in Indian Police Service (Regulation of Seniority) Rules, 1954. These rules required first to ascertain the year of allotment of the person concerned for the determination of his seniority. In doing so, the Government of India directed that officers promoted to the Indian Police Service should be allowed the benefit of their continuous officiation with effect only from 19th May, 1951. The appellant challenged the order because the period of officiation from June 1947 to May 1951 was excluded for the purpose of fixation of his seniority. His grievance was that there was no rationale behind selecting this date. After taking into consideration affidavit in opposition, this Court held as under : \"It would be noticed that the date, May 19, 1951, to begin with had nothing to do with the finalisation of the Gradation List of the Indian Police Service because it was a date which had reference to the finalisation of the Gradation List for the IAS. Further this date does not seem to have much relevance to the question of avoiding the anomalous position mentioned in para 9 of the affidavit reproduced above. This date was apparently chosen for the IAS because on this date the Gradation List for all the earlier persons recruited to the service had been finalised and issued in a somewhat stable stage. But why should this date be applied to the Indian Police Service has not been adequately explained. Mr. BRL Iyengar, the learned counsel for the appellant, strongly urges that selection of May 19, 1951, as a crucial date for classifying people is arbitrary and irrational. We agree with him in this respect. It further appears from the affidavit of Mr. D.K. Guha, Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, dated December 9, 1966 that \"the Government of India have recently decided in consultation with the Ministry of Law that the Ministry of Home Affairs letter number 2/32/51-AIS, dated the 25th August, 1955 will not be applicable to those SCS/SPS officers, who were appointed to IAS/IPS prior to the promulgation of IAS/IPS (Regulation of Seniority) Rules, 1954, and the date of the issue of the above letter if their earlier continuous officiation was approved by the Ministry of Home Affairs and Union Public Service Commission\". It further appears that \"in the case of Shri C.S. Prasad also, an IPS Officer of Bihar, a decision has been taken to give the benefit of full continuous officiation in senior posts and to revise his year of allotment accordingly.\" But, it is stated that \"as Shri Nim was appointed to IPS on the 22nd October 1955, i.e. after the promulgation of IPS (Regulation of Seniority) Rules, 1954, and after the issue of letter dated 25.8.1955, his case does not fall even under this category\". The above statement of the case of the Government further shows that the date, May 19, 1951 was an artificial and arbitrary date having nothing to do with the application of the first and the second provisos to Rule 3 (3). It appears to us that under the second proviso to Rule 3 (3) the period of officiation of a particular officer has to be considered and approved or disapproved by the Central Government in consultation with the Commission considering all the relevant facts. The Central Government cannot pick out a date from a hat-and that is what it seems to have done in this case-and say that a period prior to that date would not be deemed to be approved by the Central Government within the second proviso.\" The Court held that the Central Government cannot pick out a date from a hat and that is what it seems to have done in saying that a period prior to that date would not be deemed to be approved by the Central Government within the second proviso. In case before us, the eligibility criteria for being eligible for liberalised pension scheme have been picked out from where it is difficult to gather and no rationale is discernible nor one was attempted at the hearing. The ratio of the decision would squarely apply to the facts of this case. Similarly in Jaila Singh & ANR v. State of Rajasthan & ORS (1), this Court struck down as discriminatory the division of pre-1955 and post-1955 tenants for the purpose of allotment of land made by the Rules under the Rajasthan Colonisation Act, 1954 observing that the various provisions indicate that the pre-1955 and post-1955 tenants stand on the same footing and therefore do not form different classes and hence the division was held to be based on wholly irrelevant consideration. The court further observed that it is difficult to appreciate how it would make any difference from the point of view of allotment of land, whether a tenant has been in occupation for 16 years or 18 or 20 years and why differentiation should be made with reference to the date when Rajasthan Tenancy Act came into force. This division for the purpose of allotment of land with reference to certain date was considered both arbitrary and discriminatory on the ground that it was wholly unrelated to the objects sought to be achieved. As against this the learned Attorney-General invited our attention to Union of India & ANR v. M/s Parameswaran Match Works etc.(2) By a notification dated July 21, 1967, benefit of a concessional rate of duty was made available if a manufacturer of matches made a declaration that the total clearance of matches from a factory would not exceed 75 million during a financial year. As framed the notification extended the benefit to manufacturers with higher capacity to avail of the concessionalrate of duty by filing a declaration as visualised in the proviso to the notification by restricting their clearance to 75 million matches. This notification was amended on September 4, 1967 with a view to giving bona fide small manufacturers, whose total clearance was not estimated to be in excess of 75 million matches, the benefit of concessional rate of duty prescribed under notification dated July 21, 1967. The respondent in the case applied for a licence for manufacturing matches on September 5, 1967, that is, a day after the date on which amended notification was issued and filed a declaration that the estimated manufacture for the financial year would not exceed 75 million matches, but this was rejected. In a writ petition filed by the respondent, the High Court held that the classification was unreasonable inasmuch as the fixation of the date for making a declaration had no nexus with the object of the Act. In the appeal by the Union of India, this Court held that the concessional rate of duty was intended for small bona fide units who were in the field when the notification dated September 4, 1967 was issued. The concessional rate of duty was not intended to benefit the large units which had split up into smaller units to earn the concession. With reference to selection of the date this Court observed as under : \"The choice of a date as a basis for classification cannot always be dubbed as arbitrary even if no particular reason is forthcoming for the choice unless it is shown to be capricious or whimsical in the circumstances. When it is seen that a line or a point there must be and there is no mathematical or logical way of fixing it precisely, the decision of the legislature or its delegate must be accepted unless we can say that it is very wide of the reasonable mark.\" In reaching this conclusion the Court relied on Louisville Gas Co. v. Alabama Power Co. (1) This decision is not an authority for the proposition that whenever a date is chosen, or an eligibility criteria which divides a class, the purpose of choice unrelated to the objects sought to be achieved must be accepted as valid. In fact it is made clear in the decision itself that even if no particular reason is forthcoming for the choice unless it is shown to be capricious or whimsical, the choice of the legislature may be accepted. Therefore, the choice of the date cannot be wholly divorced from the objects sought to be achieved by the impugned action. In other words, if the choice is shown to be thoroughly arbitrary and introduces discrimination violative of article 14, the date can be struck down. What facts influenced the Court's decision in that case for upholding the choice of the date are worth- recalling. The Court held that the object of granting the concessional rate of duty was to protect the smaller units in the industry from the competition by the larger ones and that object would have been frustrated, if, by adopting the device of fragmentation, the larger units could become the ultimate beneficiaries of the bounty. This was the weighty consideration which prompted the court to uphold the date. The learned Attorney General next referred to D.C. Gouse and Co. etc. v. State of Kerala & ANR etc. (1) This Court while repelling the contention that the choice of April 1, 1973 as the date of imposition of the building tax is discriminatory with reference to article 14 of the Constitution, approved the ratio in the case of M/s. Parameswaran Match Works etc. supra. Even while reaching this conclusion the Court observed that it is not shown how it could be said that the date (April 1, 1973) for the levy of the tax was wide of the reasonable mark. What appealed to the Court was that earlier an attempt was made to impose the building tax with effect from March 2, 1961 under the Kerala Building Tax Act, 1961 but the Act was finally struck down as unconstitutional by this Court as per its decision dated August 13, 1968. While delivering the budget speech, at the time of introduction of the 1970-71 budget, the intention to introduce a fresh Bill for the levy of tax was made clear. The Bill was published in June 73 in which it was made clear that the Act would be brought into force from April 1, 1970. After recalling the various stages through which the Bill passed before being enacted as Act, this Court held that the choice of date April 1, 1973 was not wide of the reasonable mark. The decision proceeds on the facts of the case. But the principle that when a certain date or eligibility criteria is selected with reference to legislative or executive measure which has the pernicious tendency of dividing an otherwise homogeneous class and the choice of beneficiaries of the legislative/executive action becomes selective, the division or classification made by choice of date or eligibility criteria must have some relation to the objects soughtto be achieved. And apart from the first test that the division must be referable to some rational principle, if the choice of the date or classification is wholly unrelated to the objects sought to be achieved, it cannot be upheld on the specious plea that was the choice of the Legislature. Now if the choice of date is arbitrary, eligibility criteria is unrelated to the object sought to be achieved and has the pernicious tendency of dividing an otherwise homogeneous class, the question is whether the liberalised pension scheme must wholly fail or that the pernicious part can be severed, cautioning itself that this Court does not legislate but merely interprets keeping in view the underlying intention and the object, the impugned measure seeks to subserve ? Even though it is not possible to oversimplify the issue, let us read the impugned memoranda deleting the unconstitutional part. Omitting it, the memoranda will read like this : \"At present, pension is calculated at the rate of 1/80th of average emoluments for each completed year of service and is subject to a maximum of 33/80 of average emoluments and is further restricted to a monetary limit of Rupees 1,000 per month. The President is, now, pleased to decide that with effect from 31st March, 1979 the amount of pension shall be determined in accordance with the following slabs.\" If from the impugned memoranda the event of being in service and retiring subsequent to specified date is severed, all pensioners would be governed by the liberalised pension scheme. The pension will have to be recomputed in accordance with the provisions of the liberalised pension scheme as salaries were required to be recomputed in accordance with the recommendation of the Third Pay Commission but becoming operative from the specified date. It does therefore appear that the reading down of impugned memoranda by severing the objectionable portion would not render the liberalised pension scheme vague, unenforceable or unworkable. In reading down the memoranda, is this Court legislating ? Of course 'not'. When we delete basis of classification as violative of article 14, we merely set at naught the unconstitutional portion retaining the constitutional portion. We may now deal with the last submission of the learned Attorney General on the point. Said the learned Attorney- General that principle of severability cannot be applied to augment the class and to adopt his words 'severance always cuts down the scope, never enlarges it'. We are not sure whether there is any principle which inhibits the Court from striking down an unconstitutional part of a legislative action which may have the tendency to enlarge the width and coverage of the measure. Whenever classification is held to be impermissible and the measure can be retained by removing the unconstitutional portion of classification, by striking down words of limitation, the resultant effect may be of enlarging the class. In such a situation, the Court can strike down the words of limitation in an enactment. That is what is called reading down the measure. We know of no principle that 'severance' limits the scope of legislation and can never enlarge it. To refer to the Jaila Singh's case (supra), when for the benefit of allotment of land the artificial division between pre-1955 and post-1955 tenant was struck down by this Court, the class of beneficiaries was enlarged and the cake in the form of available land was a fixed quantum and its distribution amongst the larger class would protanto reduce the quantum to each beneficiary included in the class. Similarly when this Court in Randhir Singh's case (supra) held that the principle of 'equal pay for equal work' may be properly applied to cases of unequal pay based on no classification or irrational classification it enlarged the class of beneficiaries. Therefore, the principle of 'severance' for taking out the unconstitutional provision from an otherwise constitutional measure has been well recognised. It would be just and proper that the provision in the memoranda while retaining the date for its implementation, but providing 'that in respect of Government servants who were in service on the 31st March, 1979 but retiring from service in or after that date' can be legally and validly severed and must be struck down. The date is retained without qualification as the effective date for implementation of scheme, it being made abundantly clear that in respect of all pensioners governed by 1972 Rules, the pension of each may be recomputed as on April 1, 1979 and future payments be made in accordance with fresh computation under the liberalised pension scheme as enacted in the impugned memoranda. No arrears for the period prior to 31st March, 1979 in accordance with revised computation need be paid. In this context the last submission of the learned Attorney General was that as the pension is always correlated to the date ofretirement, the Court cannot change the date of retirement, and impose fresh commutation benefit. We are doing nothing of this kind. The apprehension is wholly unfounded. The date of retirement of each employee remains as it is. The average emoluments have to be worked out keeping in view the emoluments drawn by him before retirement but in accordance with the principles of the liberalised pension scheme. The two features which make the liberalised pension scheme more attractive is the redefining of average emoluments in Rule 34, and introduction of slab system simultaneously raising the ceiling. Within these parameters, the pension will have to be recomputed with effect from the date from which the liberalised pension scheme came into force i.e. March 31, 1979. There is no question of fresh commutation of pension of the pensioners who retired prior to 31st March, 1979 and have already availed of the benefit of commutation. It is not open to them to get that benefit at this late date because commutation has to be availed of within specified time limit from the date of actual retirement. May be some marginal retirees may earn the benefit."}, "annotations": [{"result": [{"value": {"start": 0, "end": 62, "text": "ORIGINAL JURISDICTION : Writ Petition numbers 5939-41 of 1980.", "labels": ["NONE"]}}, {"value": {"start": 63, "end": 235, "text": "Anil B.

From the Order dated 17.8.1984 of the Customs Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, Delhi in Appeal number ED (SB) 776/83- B) Order number 623 - B/ 84. R.F. Nariman, Sumant Bhardwaj, B.R. Agrawala and Sunil Goyal for the Appellants. A. Subba Rao, A.D.N. Rao, G. V. Rao and P. Parmeswaran for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by R. M. SAHAI, J. Two questions arise for consideration in this appeal directed against the order of the customs, Excise & Gold (Control) Appellante Tribunal Special Bench `B'. One, whether cylinder liner manufactured by the appellant out of iron casting identifiable as machine part was exigible to duty under tariff item number 68 or it continued to be iron casting and thus exempt under Notification issued under sub-rule (1) of Rule 8 of Central Excise Rules. Second, whether the authorities were precluded from issuing notice and adjudicating if the cylinder liner was a machine part, even though for an earlier period the classification list claiming it as iron casting, thus exempt, had been approved. Cylinder liner was manufactured by the appellant by casting molten iron in specific shape. By itself it was of no use. This could be said to be first stage. Its rough surface was thereafter removed. And after machining and honing it was delivered to the Railways. According to department it became identifiable as machine part. This was second stage. The Railways further treated it with honing and chrome plating before putting it to use. There is no dispute that on the first stage it is an iron casting which is exempt under item number 25. Nor there is any dispute that at the third stage it is an excisable commodity. The only dispute is if at the second stage when it was supplied by the appellant to the Railways it could be subjected to duty. According to the appellant till its final processing by the Railways it did not become a machine part. It continued to be iron casting. It is claimed that merely because it was supplied to Railways or that it became identifiable as a machine part no duty was attracted as no excisable commodity came into being. Reliance was placed on Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. v. Union of India, [1988] 3 SCR 1025. It was urged that this Court having held that rough machining before supplying after removing the excess layer of steel commonly referred to as excess skin did not convert the iron steel into wheels, tyre, and axle. According to learned counsel the principle of this case squarely applied to facts of the case. Reliance was also placed on Union of India v. Delhi Cloth & General Mills Ltd., [1963] 1 SCR 587. The main plank of the argument was that till cylinder liner was finally processed by the Railways it was incapable of being used as a machine part. To appreciate the submission it is necessary to extract tariff item 25 which reads as under : \"25, IRON IN ANY CRUDE FORM - including pig iron, scrap iron, molten iron or iron cast in any other shape or size.\" Notification number 74/62 issued on 24.4.1962 as amended by NOtification number 119/64 dated 27.6.1964, under sub-rule (1) of Rule 8 of Central Excise Rules, 1944 is extracted below: \"Exemption to iron in any crude form produced from old iron or steel scrap.- In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-rule (1) of Rule 8 of the Central Excise Rules , 1944, the Central Government hereby exempts iron in any crude form including pig, iron, scrap, iron, molten iron or iron case in any other shape or size failing under Item number 25 of the First Schedule to the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944 (1 of 1944), and produced out of old iron or steel scrap or scrap obtained from duty-paid virgin metal, is with effect from 1st March, 1964, exempted from the payment of the excise duty leviable thereon.\" In the classification list exemption was sought on cylinder liner by describing it at serial number 4 as under: \"4. Cylinder liners to Part number 10123416 which is not identifiable part in that it is partially machined only and not ready for use.\" The description of the goods as, partially machined, does not appear to be correct. The tribunal found that contract in pursuance of which the goods were manufactured was for the supply of, `fully machined cylinder liner.' And in absence of any material it was obvious that the Railways would not have accepted the cylinder unless it tallied with the specification. There was no dispute before the authorities that first machining and honing was done in assessee's factory. According to appellant it was only akin to removal of rough layer as in Tata's case whereas according to department it was much more and it resulted in rendering it as machine part. The Collector observed,' \"However, the specifications given by these clients state in particular that the first machining and honing is to be done at the assessee's end. The process mainly covers grinding which is defined as `Reducing to size by removing material by contact with a rotating, abrasive wheel; plane or cylindrical surfaces may be very accurately finished with regard to size and shapes' (as per Dictionary of Mech. Eng. Alfred Del Vecchio and Chambers' dictionary of Sc. and Tech.) Similarly, the term honing is defined as, `a term applied to fine textured even grained indurated sedimentary rocks, which may be used for imparting a keen edge to cutting tools, replaceable by silicon carbide products'. (...as per Chambers' dictionary of Sc. & Tech.).\" It is thus obvious that the processing undertaken in assessee's factory to render the cylinder liner as fully machined resulted in changing the goods from crude cast iron in size and shape to an identifiable commodity. The duty of excise is on manufacture of a good and not on its use. Reliance was placed on a letter issued by the Controller of stores Indian Railways Diesel Locomotive Works, Varanasi stating therein : \"Thus, it would be completely out of question to use the cylinder liners fully machined and after first honing as supplied by the suppliers in the engine without further processing (chrome plating and honey combing) howsoever uniform and smooth the cylinder liners supplied by the manufacturers may be.\" In our opinion it does not help the appellant. In Tata Iron & Steel Co. (supra) it was admitted in the letter of Railway that what was supplied was rough machined or forged condition. But from the letter extracted above it is clear that what was supplied by appellant was fully machined cylinder liner. That was the contract as well. The tribunal's finding that the contract was for supply of, `fully machined cylinder liners' thus stands supported even by the letter of Railways. The tribunal in the circumstances, in our opinion, was justified in recording the finding that by the time the goods cleared from factory they had ceased to be casting, and had assumed the character of fully machined cylinder liner or fully machined or proof machined cylinder which were identifiable as such. Since duty under Excise and Salt Act is leviable on manufacture of goods produced the cylinder liner became exigible to duty under Entry 68. Once the tribunal found that cylinder liner ceased to be cast iron it is obvious that the department could not be precluded from levying duty on it subject to the law of limitation. Since show cause notice which resulted in these proceedings was for a period other than for which proceedings had been dropped, it was not review as urged by the learned counsel for appellant. In Plasmac Machine Mfg. Co. Pvt Ltd. v. Collector of Central Excise, AIR 1991 SC 999 it was held by court, of which one of us (R. M. Sahai, J.) was a member, that if an item was found dutiable then the department could not be prevented from levying duty on it because it had earlier approved classification as there is no estoppel against statute. In the result this appeal fails and is dismissed with costs. G.N.

Appeal from the judgment and order dated March 25, 1969 of the Allahabad High Court in Civil Miscellaneous Writ number 2200 of 1966. S. Markandeya, for the appellant. L. M. Singhvi and O. P. Rana, for the respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Grover, J. This is an appeal by certificate from a judgment of the Allahabad High Court in which the main point involved relates to the provisions of section 9 of the U.P. Sales Tax Act, 1948, hereinafter called the 'Act'. The facts lie in a narrow compass. Lalta Prasad Khinni Lal a Hindu undivided family which is the assessee carried on business of manufacturing oils. For the assessment year 196364 it was assessed to sales tax under the Act by an order dated July 28, 1965. The assessee had been filing its quarterly returns and had deposited a sum of Rupees 3,153.01 which was the admitted amount of its tax liability. The Sales tax Officer, however, made an assessment enhancing the turnover which resulted in increase of the amount of tax. The assessee filed an a peal on October 21, 1965 which was three days before the period of limitation prescribed for filing the appeal was to expire. There was some difficulty about encashment of a cheque which had been deposited along with the rest of the cash amount towards payment of the amount of tax the liability for which stood admitted. The total payment was not made of the entire amount until May 27, 1966, when the treasury challan was produced. The assessee filed an application under section 5 of the Indian Limitation Act praying forcondonation of delay, if any, in filing the appeal. The Assistant Commissioner (Judicial) Sales Tax rejected, the memorandum of ,appeal as defective on the ground that the deposit of the amount of tax admitted to be due had not been made within the period of limitation and that the delay in doing so could not be condoned under section 5 of the Limitation Act. The assessee filed a petition under article 226 of the Constitution in the High Court challenging the order of the Assistant Commissioner (Judicial) Sales Tax. That petition was dismissed on the ground that although the appeal was filed within time there was delay in making the necessary deposit of the admitted tax and that delay could not be condoned under s.5 of the Limitation Act. Section 9 of the Act deals with an appeal against an order of assessment. It provides that any dealer objecting to an order under the various sections mentioned in sub-s.(1) may within 30 days appeal to such authority as may be prescribed. The proviso to sub-section (1) is material and is set out below \"Provided that no appeal against an assessment shall be entertained unless it is accompanied by satisfactory proof of the payment of the amount-of tax admitted by the appellant to be due or of such instalments thereof as may have become payable: Provided, secondly, that the appellate, authority shall not exercise any powers or perform any other function except those conferred on or entrusted to him as such authority.\" Sub-s.(6) of s.9 provides that s.5 of the Indian Limitation Act 1908 shall apply to appeals under the Act. The relevant Rules may next be reproduced: Rule 66(2) \"The memorandum of appeal shall be accompanied by adequate proof of payment of the fee payable and a certified copy of the order appealed against and the challan showing deposit in the treasury of the tax admitted by the appellant to be due, or of such instalments thereof as might have become pay- able\". Rule 67(3) \"If the memorandum of appeal is not in order it may be rejected or be returned, after the necessary endorsement on its back about its presentation and return, to the applicant for correction and representation within the time to be fixed by the Assistant Commissioner (Judicial) or be amended then and there\".A full bench of the Allahabad High Court considered the question of the applicability of s.5 of the Limitation Act to a case the admitted amount of tax is not deposited by the appeal within the time prescribed for filing the appeal in Janta Cycle and Motor Mart v. The Asstt. Commissioner (J.) III, Sales Tax Kanpur Range & ANR (1). The full 'bench relied on an observation of this Court in Lakshmiratan Engineering Works Ltd. v. Asstt. Commissioner (J.) I, Sales Tax, Kanpur & Another (2 ) with regard to the meaning of the word \"entertain\". According to that decision \"entertain\" meant the first occasion on which the court took up the matter for decision. It might be at the admission stage or if by the rules of the appellate Tribunal the appeals were automatically admitted it would be the time of the hearing of the appeal. The High Court considered that according to the aforesaid decision of this Court when the first proviso is read with the main provision of s.9(1) of the Act the deposit also had to be made within limitation. The High Court came to the conclusion that s.9(6) of the Act could not be applied and s.5 of the Limitation Act was not attracted when the question arose whether the delay in depositing the admitted tax should be condoned. We are wholly unable to comprehend and appreciate the above reasoning or the conclusion of the High Court on the point under consideration. It is true that an appeal filed under s.9 of the Act cannot be entertained by the appellate authority unless satisfactory proof is adduced of the payment of tax admitted by the appellant to be due but in a case where the amount of admitted tax is deposited after the period of limitation has expired all that will happen is that the appeal will become entertainable only on the day on which satisfactory proof of payment of that amount is produced. In other words the appeal will be deemed to have been properly filed on the date on which the amount of admitted tax is paid. If that is beyond the period of 30 days the appeal will be barred by time. Section 9(6) will, immediately become applicable to that appeal and it will be open to the appellant to apply for condonation of delay under that provision. We are wholly unable to follow the argument that the deposit of the amount of admitted tax must be made within 30 days even though the delay in filing the appeal can be condoned under subs.(6). A proper and correct reading of s.9 cannot justify such an approach. If a petition of appeal has been filed without proof of payment of tax accompanying it that appeal can be said to have been preferred only when proof of payment of tax is furnished. Such furnishing of the proof may take place within the period prescribed for preferring the appeal or after the lapse (1) 22 S.T.C. 94. (2) 21 S.T.C. 154.of that period. If the proof of payment of admitted tax is furnished within the period prescribed the appeal must be entertained. If the furnishing of that proof is done after the expiry of the period of limitation the question will arise whether the appeal should be entertained or not. In such cases s.9(6) will come into operation and the question will arise whether there has been sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal within the statutory period. The correct approach is to treat the appeal as having been preferred on the date on which proof of payment of the tax was furnished and' then to see whether under sub-section (6) of s.9 there was sufficient cause for excusing the delay in preferring the appeal. The decision of the Kerala High Court in Gangadharan Pillai v. Sales Tax Officer (Reserve) Ernakulam(1) is to this effect and we entirely agree with the reasoning and the conclusion therein. In Raja of Vankatagiri v. Commissioner of Income tax, Madras(2) a division bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court consisting of Subha Rao C. J. as he then was and Bhimasankaram J. had to consider the provisions of the Indian Income tax Act 1922 similar to s.9 of the Act. According to the proviso to s.30(1) of that Act no appeal lay against an order under sub-s.(1) of s.46 unless the tax had been paid. Sub-s.(2) ,of that section provided that the appeal was to be ordinarily ,presented Within 30 days but the Appellate Assistant Commissioner could admit the same after the expiration of the period if he was satisfied that the appellant had sufficient cause for not presenting it within that period. It was held that the payment of the tax was condition precedent to the maintainability of the appeal. If an appeal was filed, though after the prescribed period of time, the Assistant Commissioner had the jurisdiction to hear the appeal after the tax due was paid. The only possible objection that could have been raised was that the appeal was barred as having been filed beyond the period prescribed by s.30(2). But the appellate authority had the jurisdiction to excuse the delay. The ratio of this decision is that even though the payment of tax was a condition precedent to the maintainability of the appeal the delay could be condoned under s.30(2) thus treating the appeal as having been filed when the amount of tax was paid. The Allahabad High Court appears to have been greatly in- fluenced by the decision of this Court in Lakshmiratan Engineering Works Ltd. v. Asstt. Commissioner (J.) I Sales Tax, Kanpur(-') and by the meaning of the word \"entertain\" as explained there. We have found considerable difficulty in discovering how that decision could afford any assistance to the respondents in the present case. Indeed according to that decision the words (1) 16 S.T.C. 578. (3) 21 S.T.C. 154. (2) 28 I.T.R. 188.\"no appeal shall be entertained\" in the proviso to s.9 do not denote the filing of the memorandum of appeal but refer to the point of time when the appeal is being considered. Therefore, though the memorandum of appeal filed within time is not accompanied by the treasury challan showing payment of tax if before the appeal is being considered satisfactory proof of payment of tax is given then the proviso to s.9 is satisfied. In the present case when the assessee produced the necessary documents which showed that the deposit of the full amount had been made by May 27, 1966 the appeal became entertainable. It only suffered from the defect that it was barred by time on that date. The assessee could, therefore, apply under s.9(6) for extending the period of limitation in accordance with s.5 of the Limitation Act. It is entirely a different matter whether on the facts of the present case the appellate authority would have condoned the delay or not but to say that the appellate authority had no jurisdiction to extend the time simply because the amount of admitted tax had been deposited beyond the period of 30 days would be wholly erroneous and would not represent a true and correct ,view of the provisions of s.9. It may be pointed out that the case of Lakshmiratan Engineering Works(1) on which the High Court largely relied did not involve the question of the extension of the period of limitation under s.9(6). Indeed in our judgment the word \"entertain\" in s.9(1) has hardly any material bearing on the point under consideration. As the appellate authority disposed of the appeal on the short ground that it was barred by time and that it had no jurisdiction to extend the period of limitation this- matter will have to go back for reconsideration and redecision of that authority. In the result the appeal is allowed and the judgment of the High Court is set aside. The case is remitted to the High Court for making appropriate directions for reconsideration and rehearing of the appeal by the appellate authority under the Act. The assessee will be entitled to costs' in this Court. G.C. Appeal allowed.

Appeal by special leave from the order dated August 27, 1965 of the Punjab High Court (Circuit Bench) at Delhi in Civil Revision number 289-D of 1965. S.N. Andley, Ramevhwar Nath, Mahinder Narain, for the appellants. A. K. Sen. B. Sen, B. P. Maheshwari, P. D. Bhargava and M. S. Narasimhan, for the respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Subba Rao. J.--This appeal by special leave is directed against the order of the Punjab High Court confirming that of the Subordinate Judge, Delhi, striking out the defence of the appellant tinder section 151 of the Code of civil Procedure, hereinafter called the Code. Kanhaya Lal Bhargava, the 1st respondent, filed a suit on April 27, 1962, in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, First Class, Delhi, against Messrs. Ram Chand & Sons Sugar Mills Private Limited, the appellant, and one Ram Sarup for the recovery of a, sum of Rupees 45,112.94. Pending the suit, on October 27, 1964, the 1st respondent filed an application in the said court under O.XI, r. 21, of the Code, read with O.XXIX, r. 3, thereof, for striking off the defence or in the alternative for directing Jugal Kishore, a director of the Appellant-company, to appear in court on December 14, 1964. On December 3, 1964, the court made an order therein directing the said Jugal Kishore to be present in court on December 14, 1964, to answer material questions relating to the suit. The appellant took a number of adjournments to produce the said Jugal Kishore on the ground that the latter was ill. On February 3, 1965, the court gave the appellant a final opportunity to produce the said Jugal Kishore. Even so, the appellant took two more adjournments to produce him, but did not do so on the ground that he was ill. Finally on February 25, 1965, the court issued a notice to the 1st defendant, appellant herein, to show cause why his defence should not be struck off. On March 16, 1965, after hearing the arguments the court held that Jugal Kishore had failed to comply with the orders of the court and was persistent in his default in spite of chances given to him; and on that finding, it struck off the defence of the appellant. The High Court, on revision, held that Jugal Kishore did not appear in court in spite of orders to that effect and that the learned Subordinate Judge had Jurisdiction to strike out the defence of the appellant. It further negatived the contention of the appellant that it was not in its power to compel Jugal Kishore to appear in court on the ground that he was the director of the company and was under its control and, therefore, the appellant-company could not be heard to say CI/66---9that one of the directors did not obey the orders of the court. Hence the present appeal. The argument of Mr. S, N. Andley, learned counsel for the appellant, may be briefly stated thus: The Code of Civil Procedure provides express power for a court to strike out defence against a party under specified circumstances and, therefore, section 151 thereof cannot be invoked to strike out the defence in other circumstances, for to do so will be to override the provisions of the Code. Order XXIX, r.3, of the Code does not empower the court to require the personal appearance of a director other than a director who signed and verified the pleading within the meaning of O.XXIX, r. 1 thereof. Mr. Sen, learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand contended that the court had ample jurisdiction to strike out the defence of a party if he was guilty of abuse of the process of the court. In the instant case, he contended Jugal Kishore, one of the permanent directors of the appellant-company had adopted a recalcitrant attitude in defying the orders of the court to be present for interrogation and, therefore, the Subordinate Judge rightly, after giving every opportunity for him to be present, struck off the appellant's defence. Section 151 of the Code reads: \"Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect the inherent power of the court to make such orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of the Court.\" The words of the section appear to be rather wide. But the decisions of this Court, by construction, limited the scope of the said section In Padam Sen v. The State of Uttar Pradesh (1) the question raised was whether a Munsif had inherent powers under section 151 of the Code to appoint a commissioner to seize account books. This Court held that he had no such power. Raghubar Dayal, J., speaking for the Court, observed: \"The inherent powers of the Court are in addition to the powers specifically conferred on the Court by the Code. They are complementary to those powers and therefore it must be held that the Court is free to exercise them for the purposes mentioned in s. 151 of the Code when the exercise of these powers is not in any way in conflict with what has been expressly provided in the Code or against the intentions of the Legislature. It is also well recognized that the inherent power is not to be exercised in a manner which will be contrary to or (1) [1961] 1 S.C.R 884,887. different from the procedure expressly provided in the Code\". This Court again in Manohar Lal Chopra v. Rai Bahadur Rao Raja Seth Hiralal(1) considered the question whether a court had inherent power under section 151 of the Code to issue a temporary injunction restraining a party from proceeding with a suit in another State. In that context, Raghubar Dayal, J., after quoting the passage cited above from his earlier judgment, interpreted the said observations thus: \"These observations clearly mean that the inherent powers are not in any way controlled by the provisions of the Code as has been specifically stated in section 151 itself. But those powers are not to be exercised when their exercise may be in conflict with what had been expressly provided in the Code or against the intentions of the Legislature. This restriction, for practical purposes, on the exercise of these powers is not because these powers are controlled by the provisions of the Code but because it should be presumed that the procedure specifically provided by the Legislature for orders in certain circumstances is dictated by the interests of justice.\" This Court again in Arjun Singh v. Mohindra Kumar(2) consi- dered the scope of section 151 of the Code. One of the questions raised was whether an order made by a court under a situation to which O. IX, r. 7, of the Code did not apply, could be treated as one made under section 151 of the Code. Rajagopala Ayyangar, J., made the following observations: \"It is common ground that the inherent power of the Court cannot override the express provisions of the law. in other words, if there are specific provisions of the Code dealing with a particular topic and they expressly or by necessary implication exhaust the scope of the powers of the Court or the jurisdiction that may be exercised in relation to a matter the inherent power of the Court cannot be invoked in order to cut across the powers conferred by the Code. The prohibition contained in the Code need not be expressed but may be implied or be implicit from the very nature of the provisions that it makes for covering the contingencies to which it relates.\" Having regard to the said decisions, the scope of the inherent power of a court under section 151 of the Code may be defined thus: The inherent power of a court is in addition to and complementary to the powers expressly conferred under the Code. But that power will not be exercised if its exercise is inconsistent with, or comes (1) [1962] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 450, 461. (2) [1964] 5 S.C.R. 946, 968. into conflict with, any of the powers expressly or by necessary implication conferred by the other provisions of the Code. If there are express provisions exhaustively covering a particular topic, they give rise to a necessary implication that no power shall be exercised in respect of the said topic otherwise than in the manner prescribed by the said provisions. Whatever limitations are imposed by construction on the provisions of s.151 of the Code, they' do not control the undoubted power of the court conferred under section 151 of the Code to make a suitable order to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court. Now let us look at the relevant provisions of the Code. Order XXIX. r. 1. In suits by or against a corporation, any pleading may be signed and verified on behalf of the corporation by the secretary or by any director or other principal officer of the corporation who is able to depose to the facts of the case. r.2 Subject to any statutory provision regulating service of process, where the suit is against a corporation, the summons may be served-- (a) on the secretary, or on any director, or other principal officer of the corporation, or (b) r. 3. The Court may, at any stage of the suit, require the personal appearance' of the secretary or of any director, or other principal officer of the corporation who may be able to answer material questions relating to the suit. The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant is that the director mentioned in r. 3 is the director mentioned in r. 1 thereof. To put it in other words, the director who signs and verifies the pleadings can only be required to appear personally to answer material questions relating to the suit. Though this contention appears to be plausible, it is not sound, Rules 1, 2 and 3, of O. XXIX of the Code use the words \"any director\". Under r. 1 thereof a director who is able to depose to the facts of the case may sign and verify the pleadings; under r. 2, a summons may be served upon any director; and under r. 3, any director who may be able to answer material questions relating to the suit may be required to appear personally before the court. The adjective \"any\" indicates that any one of the directors with the requisite qualifications, prescribed by rr. 1, 2 and 3 can perform the functions laid down in each of the rules respectively. One can visualize a situation where a director who signed and verified the pleadings may not be in a position to answer certain material questions relating to the suit.If so, there is no reason why the director who may be able to answer such material questions is excluded from the scope of r. 3. Such an interpretation will defeat the purpose of the said rule. Therefore, \"any director\" in r. 3 need not be the same director who has signed and verified a pleading or on whom summons has been served. He can be any one of the directors who will be in a position to answer material questions relating to the suit. Even so, learned counsel for the appellant contended that O.XXIX, r. 3, of the Code did not provide for any penalty in case the director required to appear in court failed to do so. By drawing an analogy from other provisions where a particular default carried a definite penalty, it was argued that in the absence of any such provision it must be held that the Legislature intentionally had not provided for any penalty for the said default. In this context the learned counsel had taken us through O.IX, r. 12, O. X, r. 4, O.XI, 21, O.XVI, r. 20, and O. XVIII, rr. 2 and 3 of the Code. No doubt under these provisions particular penalties have been provided for specific defaults. For certain defaults, the relevant Orders provide for making an ex parte decree or for striking out the defence. But it does not follow from these provisions that because no such consequential provision is found in O.XXIX, the court is helpless against a recalcitrant plaintiff or defendant who happens to be a company. There is nothing in O.XXIX of the Code. which, expressly or by necessary implication, precludes the exercise of the inherent power of the court under S. 151 of the Code. We are, therefore, of the opinion that in a case of default made by a director who failed to appear in court when he was so required under O.XXIX, r. 3, of the Code, the court can make a suitable consequential order under section 151 of the Code as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of the court. The next question is whether the court can, as it did in the present case, strike off the defence of the appellant for the default made by its director to appear in court. Learned counsel for the respondent contended that both the courts in effect found that the director was guilty of a recalcitrant attitude and that he had abused the process of the court and, therefore, the Subordinate Judge had rightly exercised his inherent power in striking off the defence of the appellant, We are satisfied, as the courts below were, that Jugal Kishore, the director of the appellant-company, purposely for one reason or other, defied the orders of the court on the pretext of illness and had certainly abused the process of the court. The learned Subordinate Judge would have been well within his rights to take suitable action against him, but neither of the courts found that the appellant was responsible or instrumental for the director not attending the court. Unless there is a finding of collusion between the appellant and the director in that the formerprevented the latter from appearing in court, we find it difficult to make the company constructively liable for the default of one of its directors. Many situations may be visualized when one of the directors may not obey the directions of the company or its board of directors or may be even working against its interests. It cannot be disputed that a company and the directors of the company are different legal personalities. The company derives its powers from the memorandum of association. Some of the powers are delegated to the directors. For certain purposes they are said to be trustees and for some others to be the agents or managers of the company. It is not necessary in this case to define the exact relationship of a director qua the company. The acts of the directors within the powers conferred on them may be binding on the company. But their acts outside the said powers will not bind the company. It is not possible to hold that the director in refusing to respond to the notice given by the court was acting within the scope of the powers conferred on him. lie is only liable for his acts and not the company. If it was established that the company was guilty of abuse of the process of the court by preventing the director from attending the court, the court would have been justified in striking off the defence. But no such finding was given by the courts below. The orders of the courts below are not correct. We set aside the said orders and direct the Subordinate Judge to proceed with the suit in accordance with law. The appeal is allowed, but, in the circumstances of the case, without costs.

S. L. Aneja and K. L. Taneja for the Appellant. S. C. Manchanda, G. A. Shah and Miss A. Subhashini for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by PATHAK, J.- Is an assessee, who has concealed the particulars of his income, liable to penalty under clause (iii) of sub-section (1) of section 271 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 as it stood on the date of the concealment or as it stand during the assessment year relevant to the previous year in which the income was earned ? That is the question in this reference made by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal under section 257 of the Income Tax Act. The assessee is a partner in two firms, Messrs. Hindustan Pottery Agency and Messrs. New Crockery House. He filed a return of his total income for the assessment year 1964-65 on April24, 1968. He disclosed an income of Rupees 460 from his share in the profits of Messrs. Hindustan Pottery Agency. He did not disclose the income from his share in Messrs. New Crockery House. In the course of the assessment proceedings, the Income Tax officer found that the assessee had received income from Messrs. New Crockery House also. Because of non- compliance by the assessee with a notice issued under section 143 (2) of the Act, the Income Tax officer made a best judgment assessment under Section 144 of the Act on a total income of Rupees 12,118. This included a share income of Rupees 1,462 from Messrs. Hindustan Pottery Agency and a share income of Rupees 3,456 from Messrs. New Crockery House. Certain other items of income were also included. On appeal by the assessee, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner reduced the income from Messrs. New Crockery House to Rupees 2,955 and taking into account certain other items determined the figure of concealed income at Rupees 7,357. The Income Tax officer instituted penalty proceedings, and applied clause (iii) of sub-section (1) of section 271 of the Act, as it stand after amendment by the Finance Act, 1968. Having regard to the minimum penalty which, in his opinion, was leviable, he referred the case to the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner. The Inspecting Assistant Commissioner examined the matter, and on the basis that the concealed income was Rupees 7,357 he imposed a 13 penalty in the like sum, in view of the amended clause (iii) of subsection (1) of section 271 of the Act. The assessee appealed to the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, and contended that the amended provision could not be invoked and what came into operation was the law as it stood in the assessment year 1964-65. The Tribunal rejected the contention. But it reduced the penalty to Rupees 2,955 taking the view that the assessee was guilty of concealing the share income from Messrs. New Crockery House only. The assessee then applied for a reference. The Tribunal saw a conflict of opinion on the point raised by the assessee between the Kerala High Court in Hajee K. Asseinar v. Commissioner of Income-Tax, Kerala and the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Income Tax Reference number 45 of 1971 (decided on April, 26, 1972) which had followed Saeed Ahmed v. Inspecting Assistant Commissioner of Income-tax, Range ll, Lucknow(2) decided by the Allahabad High Court . In the circumstances, it made the present reference directly to this Court on the following question of law: \"Whether the Tribunal was, in law, right in sustaining the penalty of Rupees 2,955 by applying the provisions of section 271(1)(c) (iii) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 as amended with effect from 1-4-1968 ?\" Section 271 of the Income Tax Act provides for penalties in certain cases. Clause (c) of sub-section (1) of section 271 speaks of a case where the Income Tax officer is satisfied that a person has concealed the particulars of his income or furnished inaccurate particulars of such income. The measure of the penalty is specified in clause (iii) of the sub-section. During the assessment year 1964- 65, clause (iii) read \"(iii) in the cases referred to in clause (c), in addition to any tax payable by him, a sum which shall not be less than twenty per cent but which shall not exceed one and a half times the amount of the tax, if any, which would have been avoided if the income as returned by such person had been accepted as the correct income.\" That clause was substituted with effect from April 1, 1968 by the Finance Act, 1968 by the following:- \"(iii) in the cases referred to in clause (c), in addition to any tax payable by him, a sum which shall not be less than, but which shall not exceed twice, the amount of the income in respect of which the particulars have been concealed or inaccurate particulars have been furnished.' It is evident that the quantum of tax which is levied under the substituted clause (iii) can be greater than that imposable in terms of the original clause (iii). The case of the assessee is that an assessment proceeding for the determination of the total income and the computation of the tax liability must ordinarily be made on the basis of the law prevailing during the assessment year, and inasmuch as concealment of income is concerned with the income relevant for assessment during the assessment year any penalty imposed in respect of concealment of such income must also be governed by the law pertaining to that assessment year. We are unable to accept the contention. In our opinion, the assessment of the total income and the computation of tax liability is a proceeding which for that purpose, is governed by entirely different considerations from a proceeding for penalty imposed for concealment of income And this is so notwithstanding that the income concealed is the income assessed to tax.In the case of the assessment of income and the determination of the consequent tax liability, the relevant law is the law which rules during the assessment year in respect of which the total income is assessed and the tax liability determined. The rate of tax is determined by the relevant Finance Act. In the case of a penalty, however, we must remember that a penalty is imposed on account of the commission of a wrongful act, and plainly it is the law operating on the date on which the wrongful act is committed which determines the penalty. Where penalty is imposed for concealment of particulars of income, it is the law ruling on the date when the act of concealment takes place which is relevant. It is wholly immaterial that the income concealed was to be assessed in relation to an assessment year in the past. We do not think that the cases to which the Tribunal has referred can be said to differ on this. The concealment of the particulars of his income was effected by the assessee when he filed a return of total income on April 24, 196$,. Accordingly, it is the substituted clause (iii), brought in by the Finance Act. 1968, which governs the case. That clause came into effect from April 1, 1968. Another contention raised by the assessee may be noticed. It is urged that under section 139 of the Income Tax Act, as it stood during the assessment year 1964-65 the return of income should have been filed by the end of September, 1964 and inasmuch as the return, although filed as late as April 24, 1968, was accepted by the Income Tax officer it should be deemed that the return was treated as filed within time or, in other words, that the return had been filed by September 3(), 1964. In that event, the submission continues, the concealment of the particulars of income must be deemed to have taken place when the original clause (iii) of section (1) of section 271 of the Act was in operation. This contention is also without force. Under section 139 of the Act, although the statute itself prescribes the date by which a return of income must be filed, power has been conferred on the Income Tax officer to extend the date of furnishing the return. A return filed within the extended period is a good return in the sense that the Income Tax officer is bound to take it into consideration. But nowhere does section 13 declare that where a return is filed within the extended period it will be deemed to have been filed within the period originally prescribed by the statute. On the contrary, the section contains a provision for payment of interest where the return is filed beyond the prescribed date even though within the extended period. That is evidence of the fact that the return filed during the extended period is not regarded by the statute as filed within the time originally prescribed. Accordingly, we are of opinion that clause (iii) substituted in sub-section (1) of section 271 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 by the Finance Act, 1968, governs the case before us and, therefore, the penalty imposed on the assessee in the instant case is covered by that provision. We answer the question in the affirmative, in favour of the Revenue and against the assessee. The Revenue is entitled to its costs of this Reference. N.K.A.

Appeal from the Judgment and order dated August 7, 1961, of the Orissa High Court in Criminal Appeal number 108/60. Santosh Chatterjee and Brij Bans Kishore, for the appellants. D.R. Prem, P. D. Menon and R. H. Dhebar, for the respondent. 1962. November 23. The judgment of the Court was delivered by MUDHOLKAR, J.-This is an appeal by a certificate granted by the High Court of Orissa which dismissed an appeal preferred by the appellants from their convictions under section 500 and s. 501, Indian Penal Code, respectively and the sentences or fine imposed upon each of them. The appellant number 1, Gour Chandra Rout, is the editor of' an Oriya Daily Newspaper called \"Matrubhumi\" while' the other appellant, Ram Chandra Kar, is the printer and publisher of that newspaper. In the issue of May 31, 1958, the views expressed by Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia concerning the political situation created in Orissa by reason of the resignation of the Congress Ministry and the immediate non-acceptance of the resignation by the Governor were published. During the Press Conference addressed by Dr. Lohia he remarked that the Governor Mr. Sukthankar had played as a toy in the hands of the Congress and that a near relation of the Governor had obtained a job carrying a handsome salary, with a British Oil Company in Assam and that, therefore, the Governor was under an obligation to the Congress. The suggestion clearly was that the near relation of the Governor had secured employment with the help of the Congress Party. After the aforesaid publication came to the notice of the Governor he had a translation made of it in English and he sent that translation to the Government of Orissa for taking such action as may be necessary. Shortly thereafter the Home Secretary to the Government of Orissa passed an order in the following terms : \"Whereas the Matrubhumi' an Oriya Daily published from Cuttack in its daily edition dated May 31, 1958, knowing or having reason to believe that such a matter is defamatory of the Governor of Orissa, published a statement alleged to have been made by Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia to the effect that the Governor of Orissa in consideration of his Obligations towards the Congress Government in securing a well paid job for a near relation of his in an Oil Company in Assam favoured the Congress Party to be in power in the last political crisis in Orissa. Whereas the said statement reflects on the conduct of the Governor of Orissa in the discharge of his public function, it constitutes an offence committed by the Editor and publisher of the Matrubhumi punishable under section 501, Whereas the Secretary to the Home Department has been authorised by the Governor in this behalf under Section 198-B, (3)(a) to accord sanction to a complaint being made by the Public Prosecutor, Cuttack, against the Editor and Publisher of the said newspaper, Matrubhumi for the aforesaid offence-. Now, therefore, in pursuance of the aforesaid authority 1, Shri P. N. Mohanti, Secretary to the Government of Orissa in the Home Department do hereby accord sanction for the afore- said comment being made by the Public Prosecutor.\" This order purports to be a sanction under section 198-B of the Code of Criminal Procedure for the prosecution of the appellants for offences under section 500 and section 501, 1. P. C. respectively. In pursuance of this sanction the Public Prosecutor lodged a complaint on the basis of which the appellants were tried by the Sessions judge, Cuttack. The learned Sessions judge held both the appellants guilty of the offences with which they were charged and convicted them of those offences and sentenced them to pay certain fines, as already stated. Their appeals against their conviction and sentences were dismissed by the High Court. Section 198 of the Code prohibits a court from taking cognizance of certain offences, including those under ss. 500 and 501, 1. P. C. except upon a complaint made by a person aggrieved by such an offence. Therefore, the normal procedure is that where a person complains of being defamed he himself has to make a complaint to the court in order to make it possible for the court to take cognizance of the offence complained of. When the Code was amended by Act 26 of 1955, among other provisions, a new one, section 1998-B was added to it. The relevant part of that section runs thus : \"198-B (1).-Notwithstanding anything contained in this Code, when any offence falling under Chapter XXI of the Indian Penal Code (other than the offence of defamation by spoken words) is alleged to have been committed against the President, or the Vice-President, or the Governor or Rajpramukh of a State, or a Minister, or any other public servant employed in connection with the affairs of the union or of a State, in respect of his conduct in the discharge of his public functions, a Court of Session may take cognizance of such offence, without the accused being committed to it for trial, upon a complaint in writing made- by the Public Prosecutor. (3) No complaint under sub-section (1) shall be made by the Public Prosecutor except with the previous sanction,- (a) in the case of the President or the Vice-President or the Governor of a State of any Secretary to the Government authorised by him in this behalf; (b) in the case of a 'Minister of the Central Government or of a State Government, of the Secretary to the Council of Ministers, if any, or of any Secretary to the Government authorised in this' behalf by the Government concerned; (c) in the case of any other public servant employed in connection with the affairs of the Union or of a State of the Government concerned.\" This provision was enacted for the specific purpose of allowing the State to prosecute a person for defamation of a high dignitary of a State or a public servant, when such defamation is directed against the conduct of such person in the discharge of his public functions. It is common ground that the alleged defamation of the Governor Mr. Sukthankar does concern his conduct in the discharge of his public fun- ctions and consequently the Public Prosecutor could file a complaint. But the provisions of sub-section (3) make it clear that the Public Prosecutor cannot lodge a complaint without, in the case of a Governor, the previous sanction of a Secretary to the Government authorised by the Governor in this behalf. We have already quoted the sanction given by the Home Secretary. But that sanction will avail provided the Home Secretary had been previously authorised to accord a sanction to the lodging of a complaint. In order to prove authorisation by the Governor reliance is placed on behalf of the respondent State firstly on the evidence of the Governor himself. It seems to us,however, that the evidence of the Governor instead of supporting the contention, goes directly against it. Mr. Sukthankar has stated in his evidence categorically : \"I did not ask the Government to start this case. They did so after consultation with me. I sent the translation to the Government telling them that the facts were untrue and to take such action as deemed proper. I did not direct Government to start a case for defamation. I gave no specific written directions to Government to start this case.\" What section 198-B (3) (a) requires is that the Governor should authorise a Secretary to lodge a complaint. Mr. Sukthankar did not even purport to deal with the Secretary but with the Government. Further, he did not ask the Government to lodge a complaint but on the other hand left it to the Government to decide in their discretion whether a complaint should be lodged or not. We are, therefore, unable to hold from the evidence of the Governor that he in fact authorised even the Government to lodge a complaint. The mere circumstance that the Government held consultation with the Governor before filing the complaint does not amount to authorisation of a Secretary by the Governor. It seems plain that there are two restrictions placed upon the power of the public Prosecutor to lodge a complaint with respect to defamation of a high dignitary such as the Governor. The first is that he must have been given a sanction to lodge such complaint and the other is that the sanction should be accorded by a Secretary to the Government, authorised by the Governor in this behalf. This means that the Governor has first to consider for himself whether the alleged defamatory statement is of a kind of which he should take notice and seek to vindicate himself or whether the defamatory statement being of a trivial nature or having been made by an irresponsible person or for some other reason should be ignored. This decision has to be taken by the Governor himself and as we read the section, we are unable to say that he can leave it to some other person or an authority like the Government to decide whether a complaint should be lodged or not. It was, however, urged by Mr. Prem who appears for the State that it was enough for the Governor to say that he had no objection to the lodging of a complaint and that Mr. Sukthankar's statement that he left it to the Government to decide what action should be taken and that the Government had consulted him before it decided to take action, therefore, meets the requirements of the provisions of clause (0) of sub-section (3) of' section 198-B, Code of Criminal Procedure. He points out that since a sanction has to be given by a Secretary it is the Secretary who has to apply his mind to all the relevant facts and come to a decision whether it is in the public interest to lodge a complaint and if he finds that it is in the public interest that a complaint be lodged then to accord his sanction. The Secretary, as he rightly points out, does not merely perform a ministerial act in according the sanction and, therefore, it is enough that the Governor says that he leaves the matter to the Government meaning thereby that he would have no objection to the lodging of a complaint. While it is no doubt true that it is the sanctioning authority which has to apply its mind to the facts of a case before according sanction and that in forming the function of according the sanction in Secretary does not merely perform a ministerial act, we are clear that initiative has to be taken by the Governor by indicating unequivocally that he desires action to be taken and that the authorisation by him is not an idle formality. So when the Governor says, as Mr. Sukthankar has done in this case, that he leaves it to the Government to take such action as it thinks fit the inference must be that he is personally indifferent whether a complaint is lodged or not. When such is the attitude of-the Governor it would be futile to suggest that he has authorised the lodging of a complaint. It is no doubt possible that even though the Governor may have authorised sanction to be accorded to the lodging of a complaint the Secretary may think otherwise and decline to sanction the lodging of a complaint and that it can be said that in a sense the Secretary sits in judgment over the views expressed by the Governor which is implicit in an authorisation made by him. In our opinion the legislature had good reasons for leaving it to the Secretary to decide whether the lodging of a complaint by the Public Prosecutor should be sanctioned or not. The Secretary is expected to look at the question objectively and decide whether it is in the public interest to take notice of the alleged defamatory statement and prosecute the person who made it. A person who is directly aggrieved by the statement may not be in a position to take an objective view of an alleged defamatory statement and since the expenses for the prosecution will have to be borne by the State the legislature evidently felt that there was a good reason for leaving the final decision to a third person rather than with the aggrieved person. All the same the initiative to lodge a complaint must be taken by the Governor himself and unless he has, in pursuance of his decision to lodge a complaint authorised a Secretary to sanction its being lodged the Secretary gets no power to accord his sanction. This authorisation by him is as important as the sanction of the Secretary. The High Court, however, has held, that authorisation by the Governor is established by the evidence of Prosecution Witness 2, P.K. Sarangi. This person is an Assistant in the Home Department of the Orissa Secretariat who had placed the papers concerning the sanction before his superior officer in the Home Department and who claims to be familiar with the papers in the file. What he has stated in his exami- nation--in-chief is that the Home Secretary had been authorised by the Governor to sanction the prosecution' When he was asked in his cross-examination whether the authorisation was on the file he statedthat he was not in a position to say whether it was on the file or not. It appears that he had brought the file \"'showing the authorisation of the Governor\" but he did not produce it as he had not been permitted to produce it. Whether sanction was authorised by the Governor could be proved either from the evidence of the Governor himself or from any writing emanating from the Governor in which the Governor has said that he has authorised the lodging of a complaint. From the evidence of the Governor which we have already quoted it would be clear that there was no express authorisation of the Secretary by the Governor. The mere fact that Sarangi says that sanction to the prosecution was authorised by the Governor means nothing as he has not produced the file showing the Governor's authorisation. In the circumstances we must hold that the High Court was in error in reading the evidence of Prosecution Witness 2, Sarangi, as proving authorisation by the Governor. The High Court has further relied upon the evidence of the Deputy Secretary, Home Department. This evidence is not included in the paper book and in our opinion it has been rightly excluded. The evidence was given by the Deputy Secretary not at the trial but in a revision petition before the High Court. This revision petition was preferred by the appellants challenging the validity of the sanction. It appears that in that petition the appellants had contended that the sanction had not been authorised by the Governor. The High Court in its discretion allowed additional evidence to be led to. prove the authorisation and one of the witnesses examined before the High Court was the Deputy Secretary. We are unable to appreciate how evidence tendered before another court and in other proceedings could be treated as evidence at the trial. Moreover, that evidence does not appear to have been put to the appellants when they were examined under section 342, Criminal . P. C. In these circumstances we must hold that the High Court could not place any reliance on the evidence of the Deputy Secretary. Finally the contention of Mr. Prem is that there was a general authorisation by the Governor in the year 1956 and that authorisation was sufficient. The authorisation relied upon by him is in the following terms : \"In exercise of the powers conferred by clause (a) of sub- section (3) of section 198-B of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (V of 1898), the Governor hereby authorises the Secretary to Government of Orissa in the Home Department to accord previous sanction to the making of complaints under sub-section (1) of the said section in case where such complaints are made of an offence alleged to have been committed against the Governor.\" The question is whether S. 198-B (3) (a) contemplates a general authorisation. In support of his contention he first relies upon the decision in Gour Chandra Bout v. Public Prosecutor (1). That in fact is the decision of the High Court in the Revision Petition preferred by these very petitioners in which they challenged the validity of the sanction. The learned Chief justice, who decided the application has, however, not decided the point as to whether a general authorisation of the kind contained in the notification quoted above meets the requirements of the law. He- dismissed the revision petition on the basis of the additional evidence recorded by him. It has to be borne in mind that sub-section (3) of S. 198-B speaks of a complaint under sub-section (1) and the complaint under sub-S. (1) is a specific complaint in writing made by the Public Prosecutor. Therefore, reading the two sub- sections together it would be clear that the authorisation by the Governor is of (1) A.I.R. 1960 Orissa 116.the sanction with respect to a specific complaint. A general sanction can, therefore, not be of any avail. The High Court has relied upon section 14 of the General Clauses Act in support of its conclusion that a general authorisation would meet the requirements of clause (a) of sub-section (3) of s. 198-B, Criminal P C. That section deals with the exercise of a power successively and has no relevance to the question whether the power claimed can at all be conferred. We may further point out that clause (a) contemplates authorisation by the Governor defamed and, therefore, an authorisation of the type which we have here made by someone else in 1956 can be of no avail. Indeed, considering the nature 'of the offence it is difficult to appreciate how an authorisation in advance to sanction the making of a complaint of defamation can at all be given. If such authorisation were good in law, the Secretary authorised can suo motu sanction the making of a complaint, without reference to the Governor. This may lead to the astounding result that even where a high dignitary wanted to ignore a defamatory statement because it is beneath notice or because it may lead to embarrassment to him the Secretary can set the law in motion and either make a mountain out of a mole hill or embarrass the Governor himself. Such a construction would defeat the very object which the legislature had in view when it enacted the provision. We, therefore, reject the argument of learned counsel and hold that the sanction given by the Secretary, Home Department was not duly authorised by the Governor. Upon this view it is not necessary to consider some other points raised by learned counsel for the appellants. We, therefore, allow the appeal and set aside the conviction and sentences passed on each of the appellants and direct that the fines if paid, be refunded.

From the Judgment and Order dated 28-7-1971 of the Allahabad High Court in Income Tax Ref. number 335/66. J. P. Goyal and S. K. Jain for the Appellant. D. V. Patel, J. Ramamurthy and Miss A. Subhashini for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI, J.-The dispute in this appeal by certificate relates to two items of expenditure incurred by the assessee during the assessment year 1956-57 for which the relevant accounting year was the year ending on 30th September, 1955. The assessee is a private limited company carrying on business of manufacture and sale of crystal sugar in a factory situated in Pilibhit in the State of Uttar Pradesh. In the year 1952-53, a dam was constructed by the State of Uttar Pradesh at a place called Deoni and a road Deoni Dam- Majhala was constructed connecting the Deoni Dam with Majhala. It seems that the Collector requested the assessee to make some contribution towards the construction of the Deoni Dam and the Deoni Dam-Majhala Road and pursuant to this request of the Collector, the assessee contributed a sum of Rupees 22,332 during the accounting year ending 30th September, 1955. The assessee also contributed a sum of Rupees 50,000 to the State of Uttar Pradesh during the same accounting year towards meeting the cost of construction of roads in the area around its factory under a Sugarcane Development Scheme promoted by the Uttar Pradesh Government as part of the Second Five Year Plan. It was provided under the Sugarcane Development Scheme that one third of the cost of construction of roads would be met by the Central Government, one thirdby the State Government and the remaining one third by Sugar factories and sugarcane growers and it was under this scheme that the sum of Rupees 50,000 was contributed by the assessee. In the course of its assessment to Income-tax for the assessment year 1956-57, the assessee claimed to deduct these two amounts of Rupees 22,332 and Rupees 50,000 as deductible expenditure under Section 10(2)(xv) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922. The Income-tax Officer disallowed the claim for deduction on the ground that the expenditure incurred was of capital nature and was not allowable as a deduction under Section 10(2)(xv). The assessee preferred an appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner but the appeal failed and this led to the filing of a further appeal before the Tribunal. The appeal was heard by a Bench of two members of the Tribunal and there was a difference of opinion between them. The Judicial Member took the view that the expenditure of both the amounts of Rupees 22,332 and Rupees 50,000 was in the nature of revenue expenditure and was therefore allowable as a deduction, while the Accountant Member held that this expenditure was on capital account and could not be allowed as revenue expenditure. Since there was a difference of opinion between the two members, the question which formed the subject matter of difference was referred for consideration to a third member. The third member did not go into the question whether the expenditure incurred by the assessee was in the nature of capital or revenue expenditure but took a totally different line and held that the contributions were made by the assessee as a good citizen just as any other person would and it could not be said that the expenditure was laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the business of the assessee. The third member in this view agreed with the conclusion reached by the Accountant Member and held that both the amounts of Rupees 22,332 and Rupees 50,000 were not allowable as deductible expenditure under Section 10(2)(xv). The appeal of the assessee was accordingly rejected by the Tribunal so far as this point was concerned. The assessee thereupon sought a reference to the High Court and on the application of the assessee, the following question of law was referred for the opinion of the High Court : \"Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case the sums of Rupees 22,332 and Rupees 50,000 were admissible deduction in computing the taxable profits and gains of the companies business.\" The High Court observed \"that on the finding recorded by the third member of the Tribunal and on the view expressed by the Accountant Member\". the expenditure could not be said to have been incurred by the assessee in the ordinary course of its business and it could not be \"classified as revenue expenditure on the ground of commercialexpediency\". The view taken by the High Court was that since \"the expenditure was not related to the business activity of the assessee as such, the Tribunal was justified in concluding that it was not wholly and exclusively laid out for the business and that the deduction claimed by the assessee therefore did not come within the ambit of Section 10(2)(xv)\". The High Court accordingly answered the question referred to it in favour of the revenue and against the assessee. The assessee thereupon preferred to present appeal in this Court after obtaining the necessary certificate from the High Court. Now an expenditure incurred by an assessee can qualify for deduction under Section 10(2)(xv) only if it is incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of his business, but even if it fulfils this requirement, it is not enough it must further be of revenue as distinct from capital nature. Two questions therefore arise for consideration in the present appeal : one is whether the sums of Rupees 22,332 and Rupees 50,000 contributed by the assessee represented expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the business of the assessee and the other is whether this expenditure was in the nature of capital or revenue expenditure. So far the first item of expenditure of Rupees 22,332 is concerned, the case does not present any difficulty at all, because it was common ground between the parties that this amount was contributed by the assessee long after the Deoni Dam and the Deoni Dam-Majhala Road were constructed and there is absolutely nothing to show that the contribution of this amount had anything to do with the business of the assessee or that the construction of the Deoni Dam or the Deoni Dam-Majhala Road was in any way advantageous to the assessee's business. The amount of Rupees 22,332 was apparently contributed by the assessee without any legal obligation to do so, purely as an act of good citizenship, and it could not be said to have been laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the business of the assessee. The expenditure of the amount of Rupees 22,332 was therefore rightly disallowed as deductible expenditure under section 10(2)(xv). But the position is different when we come to the second item of expenditure of Rupees 50,000. There the assessee is clearly on firmer ground. The amount of Rupees 50,000 was contributed by the assessee under the Sugar-cane Development Scheme towards meeting the cost of construction of roads in the area around the factory. Now there can be no doubt that the construction of roads in the area around the factory was considerably advantageous to the business of the assessee, because it facilitated the running of its motor vehicles for transportation of sugarcane so necessary for its manufacturing activity. It is not as if the amount of Rupees 50,000 was contributed by the assessee generallyfor the purpose of construction of roads in the State of Uttar Pradesh, but it was for the construction of roads in the area around the factory that the contribution was made and it cannot be disputed that if the roads are constructed around the factory area, they would facilitate the transport of sugarcane to the factory and the flow of manufactured sugar out of the factory. The construction of the roads was therefore clearly and indubitably connected with the business activity of the assessee and it is difficult to resist the conclusion that the amount of Rupees 50,000 contributed by the assessee towards meeting the cost of construction of the roads under the Sugarcane Development Scheme was laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the business of the assessee. This conclusion was indeed not seriously disputed on behalf of the Revenue but the principal contention urged on its behalf was that the expenditure of the amount of Rupees 50,000 incurred by the assessee was in the nature of capital expenditure, since it was incurred for the purpose of bringing into existence an advantage for the enduring benefit of the assessee's business. The argument of the Revenue was that the newly constructed roads though not belonging to the assessee brought to the assessee an enduring advantage for the benefit of its business and the expenditure incurred by it was therefore in the nature of capital expenditure. The Revenue relied on the celebrated test laid down by Lord Cave L.C. in British Insulated and Helsby Cables Ltd. v. Atherson where the learned Law Lord stated \"When an expenditure is made, not only once and for all, but with a view to bringing into existence an asset or an advantage for the enduring benefit of a trade, there is very good reason (in the absence of special circumstances leading to an opposite conclusion) for treating such an expenditure as properly attributable not to revenue but to capital\". This test enunciated by Lord Cave L.C. is undoubtedly a well known test for distinguishing between capital and revenue expenditure, but it must be remembered that this test is not of universal application and, as the parenthetical clause shows, it must yield where there are special circumstances leading to a contrary conclusion. The non-universality of this test was emphasised by Lord Radcliffe in Commissioner of Taxes v. Nohanga Consolidated Copper Mines Ltd.(2) where the learned Law Lord said in his highly felicitous language that it would be misleading to suppose that in all cases securing a benefit for the business would be prima facie capital expenditure \"so long as the benefit is not so transitory as to have to endurance at all\". It was also pointed out by this Court in Empire Jute Co. Ltd. v.C.I.T. that \"there may be cases where expenditure, even if incurred for obtaining advantage of enduring benefit, may, nonetheless, be on revenue account and the test of enduring benefit may break down. It is not every advantage of enduring nature acquired by an assessee that brings the case within the principle laid down in this test. What is material to consider is the nature of the advantage in a commercial sense and it is only where the advantage is in the capital field that the expenditure would be disallowable on an application of this test.\" If the advantage consists merely in facilitating the assessee's business operations or enabling management and conduct of the assessee's business to be carried on more efficiently or more profitably while leaving the fixed capital untouched, the expenditure would be on revenue account, even though the advantage may endure for an indefinite future. Now it is clear on the facts of the present case that by spending the amount of Rupees 50,000, the assessee did not acquire any asset of an enduring nature. The roads which were constructed around the factory with the help of the amount of Rupees 50,000 contributed by the assessee belonged to the Government of Uttar Pradesh and not to the assessee. Moreover, it was only a part of the cost of construction of these roads that was contributed by the assessee, since under the Sugarcane Development Scheme, one third of the cost of construction was to be borne by the Central Government, one third by the State Government and only the remaining one third was to be divided between the sugarcane factories and sugarcane growers. These roads were undoubtedly advantageous to the business of the assessee as they facilitated the transport of sugarcane to the factory and the outflow of manufactured of sugar from the factory to the market centres. There can be no doubt that the construction of these roads facilitated the business operations of the assessee and enabled the management and conduct of the assessee's business to be carried on more efficiently and profitably. It is no doubt true that the advantage secured for the business of the assessee was of a long duration in as much as it would last so long as the roads continued to be in motorable condition, but it was not an advantage in the capital field, because no tangible or intangible asset was acquired by the assessee nor was there any addition to or expansion of the profit making apparatus of the assessee. The amount of Rupees 50,000 was contributed by the assessee for the purpose of facilitating the conduct of the business of the assessee and making it more efficient and profitable and it was clearly an expenditure on revenue account. It was pointed out by Lord Radcliffe in commissioner of Taxes v. Nothanga Consolidated Copper Mines Ltd. (supra) that \"in considering allocation of expenditure between the capital and income accounts, it is almost unavoidable to argue from analogy.\" There are always cases falling indisputably on one or the other side of the line and it is a familiar argument in tax courts that the case under review bears close analogy to a case falling on the right side of the line and must, therefore, decide in the same manner. If we apply this method, the case closest to the present one is that in Lakshmiji Sugar Mills Co. P. Ltd. v. C.I.T.(1) The facts of this case were very similar to the facts of the present case. The assessee in this case was also a limited company carrying on business of manufacture and sale of sugar in the State of Uttar Pradesh and it paid to the Cane Development Council certain amounts by way of contribution for the construction and development of roads between sugarcane producing centres and the sugar factory of the assessee and the question arose whether this expenditure was allowable as revenue expenditure under S. 10(2)(xv). No doubt, in this case, there was a statutory obligation under which the amount in question was contributed by the assessee, but this Court did not rest its decision on the circumstance that the expenditure was incurred under statutory obligation. This Court analysed the object and purpose of the expenditure and its true nature and held that it was of a revenue and not capital nature. This Court observed : \"In the present case, apart from the element of compulsion, the roads which were constructed and developed were not the property of the assessee nor is it the case of the revenue that the entire cost of development of those roads was defrayed by the assessee. It only made certain contribution for road development between the various cane producing centres and the mills. The apparent object and purpose was to facilitate the running of its motor vehicles or other means employed for transportation of sugarcane to the factory. From the business point of view and on a fair appreciation of the whole situation the assessee considered that the development of the roads in question could greatly facilitate the transportation of sugarcane. This was essential for the benefit of its business which was of manufacturing sugar in which the main raw material admittedly consisted of sugarcane. These facts would bring it within the second part of the principle mentioned before, namely, that the expenditure was incurred for running the business or working it with a view to produce the profits without the assessee getting any advantage of an enduring benefit to itself. (Emphasis supplied) These observations are directly applicable in the present case and we must hold on the analogy ofthis decision that the amount of Rupees 50,000 was contributed by the assessee \"for running the business or working it with a view to produce the profits without the assessee getting any advantage of an enduring benefit to itself\". This decision fully supports the view that the expenditure of the amount of Rupees 50,000 incurred by the assessee was on revenue account. We must also refer to the decision of this Court in Travancore-Cochin Chemicals Ltd. v. C.I.T. (Supra) on which strong reliance was placed on behalf of the Revenue. The facts of this case are undoubtedly to some extent comparable with the facts of the present case. But ultimately in cases of this kind, where the question is whether a particular expenditure incurred by an assessee is on capital account or revenue account, the decision must ultimately depend on the facts of each case. No two cases are alike and quite often emphasis on one aspect or the other may tilt the balance in favour of capital expenditure or revenue expenditure. This Court in fact in the course of its judgment in Travancore- Cochin Chemicals Ltd.'s case (supra) distinguished the decision in Lakshmiji Sugar Mills' case (supra) on the ground that \"on the facts of that case, this court was satisfied that the development of the roads was meant for facilitating the carrying on of the assessee's business. Lakshmiji Sugar Mills' case is quite different on facts from the one before us and must be confined to the peculiar facts of that case.\" We would make the same observation in regard to the decision in Travancore-Cochin Chemicals' case (supra) and say that decision must be confined to the peculiar facts of that case, because Lakshmiji Sugar Mills' case (supra) admittedly bears a closer analogy to the present case than the Travancore-Cochin Chemicals' case and if at all we apply the method of arguing by analogy, the decision in Lakshmiji Sugar Mills case (supra) must be regarded as affording us greater guidance in the decision in the present case then the decision in Travancore-Cochin Chemicals' case (supra). Moreover, we find that the parenthetical clause in the test formulated by Lord Cave L.C. in Antherton's case (supra) was not brought to the attention of this Court in Travancore-Cochin Chemicals' case with the result that this Court was persuaded to apply that test as if it were an absolute and universal test regardless of the question applicable in all cases irrespective whether the advantage secured for the business was in the capital field or not. We would therefore prefer to follow the decision in Lakshmiji Sugar Mills' case (Supra) and hold on the analogy of that decision that the amount of Rupees 50,000 contributed by the assessee represented expenditure on the revenue account. We accordingly dismiss the appeal in so far as the expenditure of the sum of Rupees 22,332 is concerned. But, so far as the expenditure of the sum of Rupees 50,000 is concerned, we hold that it was in the nature of revenue expenditure laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the assessee's business and was therefore, allowable as a deduction under Section 10(2)(xv) of the Act and allow the appeal to this limited extent. Since the assessee has partly won and partly lost, we think that the fair order of costs would be that each party should bear and pay its own costs throughout. S.R.

Ms. Rani Chhabra, K. Ramkumar, Govind Mukhoty and Vimal Dave for the Petitioners. M.K. Ramamurthy (NP), K.K. Venugopal, H.S. Gururaj Rao, Ms. Chandan Ramamurthi, M.A. Krishnamurthi, T.versus N. Chaff, S. Markandeya, W.A. Nomani, G.S. Giri Rao and A.K. Raina for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by RANGANATH MISRA, J. These are petitions under article 32 of the Constitution. Petitioners are promotee-Engineers of the Roads & Buildings Wing of the Andhra Pradesh Engineering Service and challenge mainly is to certain earlier decisions of this Court resolving similar disputes by judgments ren- dered in writ petitions and to the guidelines formulated by the State Government in the matter or' the drawing up of the seniority list by way of implementation of this Court's directions. Facts are not in dispute. Shortly stated, under the Rules substantive vacancies in the category of Assistant Engineers have to be filled up from two sources--37-I/2 per cent by direct recruitment and the remainder of 62-1/2 per cent by transfer of Supervisors and Draughtsmen and by promotion of Junior Engineers. Regular direct recruitment had not been made as and when due and promotees beyond the limit had been put in in the place of direct recruits. While disposing of a group of petitions in a contest of this type in K. Siva Reddy & ORS v. State of A.P. & ORS , [1988] Suppl. SCC 225, a two-Judge Bench of this Court instead of disturbing the entire group of promotee Engineers in excess of the quota, made the following direction: \"Reopening the question of inter se seniority on the basis of non-enforcement of the rules from the very beginning may create hardship and that would be difficult to mitigate but we see no justification as to why the benefit of the scheme under the rules should not be made available to direct recruits at least from 1982. When the State Government by rules duly framed prescribed the method of recruitment and put the scheme into operation it had the obligation to comply with it. The explanation offered by the State Govern- ment for non-compliance of the requirements of the rules does not at all impress us. We, therefore, direct that as on December 31, 1982, the State Government must ascertain the exact substantive vacancies in the category of Assistant Engineers in the service. On the basis that 37-1/2 per cent of such vacancies were to be filled up by direct recruit- ment, the position should be worked out. Promotees should be confined to 62 1/2 per cent of the substantive vacancies and in regard to 371/2 per cent of the vacancies the shortfall should be filled up by direct recruitment. General Rules shall not be applied to the posts within the limits of 37 1/2 percent of the substantive vacancies and even if promo- tees are placed in those posts, no seniority shall be count- ed.The State Government shall take steps to make recruitment of the shortfail in the direct recruitment vacancies within the limit of 37 1/2 per cent of the total substantive vacan- cies up to December 31, 1987 within four months from today by following ,the normal method of recruitment for direct recruits. The seniority list in the cadre of Assistant Engineers shall be redrawn up, as directed by the Tribunal, by the end of September 1988, keeping the directions re- ferred to above in view. Thereshall be a direction issued to the State of Andhra Pradesh to make recruitment to the category of Assistant Engineers by strict compliance of Special Rules henceforth.\" The State Government came forward to implement the direction and published the draft seniority list drawn up on the basis of discussed guidelines. Keeping the directions in view the draft list placed the 1982 direct recruits from serial numbers 234 to 269 without disturbing promotees upto serial number 233 and the remainder of promotees given promo- tion prior to 1982 were placed against serial numbers 270 to 300. Writ petition number 369 of 1989--C. Radhakrishna Reddy & ORS v. State of A. P. & ORS , had earlier raised the same dispute. By judgment dated November 10, 1989, while dismiss- ing the said writ petition a two-Judge Bench of this Court said: \"In Siva Reddy's case this Court found that promotees had exceeded the quota and even got regularised in respect of the posts in excess of the limit. Taking into consideration the fact that regularisation had been done after the promo- tees had put in some years of service and disturbing regu- larisation would considerably affect the officers concerned, regularisation was not interfered with. This Court's inten- tion obviously was not to take away the benefit of regulari- sation in respect of the officers belonging to the promotee group in excess of their quota but the Court did not intend to allow such regularised officers in excess of the quota to also have the benefit of such service for purposes of sen- iority. A reading of the judgment in Siva Reddy's case clearly indicates that this Court intended what the Govern- ment have laid down by way of guideline. We see no justifi- cation to interfere with the Government direction. A draft seniority list on the basis of such direction has already been drawn up and has been circulated. We are told that objections have been received and would be dealt with in usual course by the appropriate authorities. This writ petition had been entertained in view of the allegation that the Government direction was on a misconception of what was indicated in the judgment and in case there was any such mistake the same should be rectified at the earliest. Now that we have found that the Government order is in accord with the Court direction, this writ petition must be dis- missed and individual grievances, if any, against the draft seniority list would, we hope, be consid- ered on the basis of objections filed by the competent authority.\" At the hearing Mr. Mukhoty, appearing in support of the main petition, vehemently contended that serious injustice had been done to the promotees and accrued rights of theirs had been disturbed. He submitted that some of the direct recruits had been given the benefit of seniority by counting service prior to their actual recruitment and relied upon observations made by this Court in some cases to the effect that for computation of length of service the period prior to selection was being counted by a deeming position of employment prior to recruitment. When called upon to sub- stantiate his allegation, he has not been able to do so. On the other hand, the Court had taken a very equitable view in not disturbing the regularisation contrary to the quota and had taken every care to ensure that the cause of justice was not made to suffer and a balance was maintained by an appro- priate admixture of relief by confining the reconsideration for a period after 1982. The year 1982 was fixed, as the reasonings indicate, on account of two features--(i) that regular disputes had been raised from that time; and (ii) a period of 5-6 years was not too long a period to give rise to a sense of conclusiveness generated by long lapse of time. The promotee-Engineers should have been happy and thankful to their lot that their regularisation was not disturbed and even seniority prior to 1982 was not being affected. Oblivious of these benefits which they have re- tained though acquired out of turn, they have proceeded on the footing that their cause has been affected and justice to them has been denied by placing a group of them below the 1982 recruits. We do not think that for dismissing this group of petitions anything more should be said excepting to quote with approval what this Court had said in Dr. G. Marulasiddaiah v. Dr. T.G. Siddapparadhya & ORS , [1971] 1 SCC 568: \"The canker of litigiousness has spread even to a sphere of life where discipline should check ambition concerning personal preferment.\" A government servant is justified in taking legal action when he feels that a stigma or punishment is undeserved but he is expected to bear with fortitude and reconcile himself to his lot suppressing disappointment when he finds a co- worker raised to a position which he himself aspired after. Ordinarily, we would have awarded exemplary costs but with a view to allowing an appropriate reconciliation of the petitioners to their lot and not to give them a feeling of infliction of any new injury, we refrain from doing so.

Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated October 7, 1960 of the Patna High Court in Criminal Revision number 460 of 1960. B. B. Tawakley, Mrs. E. Udayaratnam and R. C. Prasad, for the appellant. D. P. Singh, M. K. Ramamurthi, R. K. Gary and S. C. Agarwal, for respondent number 1. 1963. March 14. Subba Rao J. delivered his own judgment. The judgment of Dayal and Mudholkar JJ., was delivered by Mudholkar J. SUBBA RAO J.-I have perused the judgment prepared by my learned brother Mudholkar J. I agree that the appeal should be dismissed. -but I would prefer to give my own reasons for doing so. The facts giving rise to this appeal are simple. The appellant is a medical practitioner and during the year 1959 he was acting as Deputy Superintendent, Jahanabad Sub- Divisional Hospital and Superintendent, Sub Jail, Jahanabad. A criminal case was pending before the Court of the Munsif- Magistrate, First Class. Jahanabad, and the two accused therein filed a petition in that Court for releasing them on bail. On October 3, 1959, the learned Munsif-Magistrate called for a report from the said medical officer of his opinion on the health of the said accused. The said officer examined theaccused and sent the following report to the Munsif- Magistrate \"Examined accused Ramsewak Dusadh and Ramdeo Dusadh of village Havellipur, P. S. Ghosi, district Gaya and found that both of them are suffering from Hookworm infections and are anaemic.\" On October 19, 1959 the learned Munsif -Magistrate made the following order granting bail to the said accused : \"In view of the order dated 3-10-1959 a petition signed by Superintendent, Sub-jail, Jahanabad, is received. In this petition it is mentioned that the accused persons are suffering from Hookworm infection and hence they are anaemic. From the petition it appears that its body portion has been written by somebody else and it is simply signed by Mr. R. Saran, Superintendent. It is curious to note that no actual examination report has been attached with this petition. It is an extreme case of carelessness on the part of the Doctor concerned. He ought to have realised that a judicial order would be passed on his actual report and not on his petition. Hence let the copy of this petition and order sheet he forwarded to the Civil Surgeon, Gaya, for information. It is argued by the lawyer appearing on behalf of the accused that these accused-, persons are poor and would not be in a position to defend themselves, in case they would not be allowed bail. I therefore on considering their poor circumstances and ill health allow them- to remain on bail on Rupees 500with one surety for the like amount.\" After making some infructuous attempts through administrative channels to get the said remarksagainst him expunged, the said medical officer filed a revision petition under ss. 435 and 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure against the said order in the High Court of judicature at Patna. The High Court dismissed the revision petition. Hence the appeal. Learned counsel for the appellant contendend that the remarks made by the learned Munsif Magistrate were unjustified and groundless and that they would affect the appellant's future official career and, therefore, the High Court should have expunged the said remarks. Learned counsel for the respondents, apart from justifying the remarks, contended that the High Court had no jurisdiction to expunge the remarks from, the judgment which had become final. At the outset I would like to make it clear that I am not expressing my opinion on the question whether the High Court in an appeal or a revision filed therein by an aggrieved party can expunge the remarks made by the trial Court in its judgment in disposing of the said appeal or revision. I am only addressing myself to the limited question whether in a case where the judgment has become final, that is to say, when no appeal has been preferred against the judgment by an aggrieved party, the High Court can expunge any remarks found therein at the instance of a third party. I am also confining the scope of my judgment to the power of an appellate Court to expunge remarks in a criminal case. The only power on which reliance is placed by learned counsel for the appellant is that contained in section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which reads : \"Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent power of the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under this Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.\" The Judicial Committee in two decisions, viz., Emperor v. Nazir Ahmad (1), and Jairam Das v. Emperor (2), had taken the view that the said section gives no new powers but only provides that those which the Court already inherently possesses shall be preserved What is the scope of this inherent power ? Can it be invoked in a case where the judgment has become final to expunge the remarks made therein ? By expunging remarks what does the appellate Court do ? Substantially it strikes out a part of the judment. Sometimes the part struck out may be an in- tegral part of the judgment, that is to say, the conclusion may not flow in the absence of the part deleted. On some occasions remarks made by a Court on the credibility of a witness, however exaggerated they may be, may be the sole reason for not believing that witness. There may also be other occasions when the remarks may be so irrelevant that they may not have any direct impact on the judgment, but such instances will be very rare. Whatever may be the decree of impact, the result of expunging remarks from a judgment is that it derogates from its finality. There is no provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure which enables an appellate Court in a case where the order of a lower Court has become final between the State and the accused to modify the said order by deleting or striking out some of the observations found therein. Does section 561 A of the said Code confer such a power ? The conflicting views on this question are reflected in some of the judgments cited at the Bar. Sulaiman j. in Panchanan Banerji v. Upendra Nath Bhattwharji (3), holds that section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which was added in 1923, confers such a power and (1) A. 1. R. 1945 P. C. 18, 22. (2) (1945) 47 Bom. L. R. 634. (P.C.) (3) (1926) 1. L. R. 49 All, 254, 256.he does not see any reason why such an inherent power should not comprise a power to order a deletion of passages which are either irrelevant or inadmissible and which adversely affect the character of persons before the Court. Tek Chand J. In the matter of Daly (1), also concedes such a power to an appellate Court. Beaumont C. J. in Rogers, P. J. v. Shrinivas Gopal (2), remarks tersely that no Court can claim inherent power to alter the judgment of another Court. Dhavle J. in Bhutnath Khawas v. Dasrathi Das (3), agrees with Beaumont C.J. in holding that no Court can claim inherent power to alter the judgment of another Court. The Madras High Court in In re Public Prosecutor (4), holds that an appellate Court has power to expunge remarks in a judgment in a suitable case. The Full Bench of the Bombay High Court in State v. Nilkanth Shripad (5), posed the question thus : \"The important question that arises is whether a superior Court has inherent power to alter the record, as it were, by changing or altering a judgment which has already been delivered and has become final as far as that particular Court is concerned\", and expressed its view as follows : \"A judgment of a lower Court may be wrong; it may even be perverse The proper way of attack that judgment is by bringing it under the scrutiny of the superior Court and getting the judgment of the lower Court judicially corrected........................................... .... In our opinion, the inherent power that the High Court possesses is, in proper cases, even though no appeal or revision may be preferred to this Court to judicially correct the observations of the lower Court by pointing out that the observations made by the Magistrate were not justified or were without any foundation or were wholly wrong or improper.\" With respect, I agree with the conclusion arrived (1) (1927) 1. L. R. 9 Lah, 269, 275. (2) I. L.R. 1940 Bom. 415, 418, (3) A. 1. R, 1941 Pat. 544. (4) A.I.R. 1944 Mad, 614. (5) I.L.R. 1954 Bom 148,157, 160.at by the Bombay High Court. This judgment, if I may say so with respect, reconciles the doctrine of finality of a judgment and the necessity to give relief in an appropriate case to a person who is not a party to a proceeding, if uncharitable, unmerited and irrelevant remarks are made against him without any foundation whatsoever. The other decisions taking the contrary view infringe the fundamental principle of jurisprudence that a judgment made by a Court, however inferior it may be in the hierarchy, is final and it can only be modified in the manner prescribed by the law governing such procedure. All the learned judges construing the scope of section 561 A of the Code of Criminal Procedure have agreed on one question namely, to preserve the independence of judicial officers so that they may express their views without fear or favour. The observations made by some of the Judges are apposite in this context. Tek Chand J. observed in In the matter of Daly (1) : \"It is of the utmost importance to the admini- stration of Justice that Courts should be allowed to perform their functions freely and fearlessly and without undue interference by this Court.\" Chagla C. J. in State v. Nilkanth Shripad observed : \"It is very necessary, in order to maintain the independence of the judiciary, that every Magistrate, however junior, should feel that he can fearlessly give expression to his own opinion in the judgment which he delivers. If our Magistrates feel that they ,cannot frankly and fearlessly deal with matters that come before them and that the High Court is likely to interfere with their opinions, the independence of the judiciary might be seriously undermined.\" I entirely agree with the remarks. I reiterate that every judicial officer must be free to express his mind (1927) 1 T.R. 9 Lab, 269, 275. (2) I.L.R. 1954 Bom. 148, 157, 160,in the matter of the appreciation of evidence before him. The phraseology used by a particular judge depends upon his inherent reaction to falsehood, his comparative command of the English language and his felicity of expression. There is nothing more deleterious to the discharge of judicial functions than to create in the mind of a judge that he should conform to a particular pattern which may, or may not be, to the liking of the appellate Court. Sometimes he may overstep the mark. When public interests conflict, the lesser should yield to the larger one. An unmerited and undeserved insult to a witness may have to be tolerated in the general interests of preserving the independence of the judiciary. Even so, a duty is cast upon the judicial officer not to deflect himself from the even course of justice by making disparaging and undeserving remarks on persons that appear before him as witnesses or otherwise. Moderation in expression lends dignity to his office and imparts greater respect for judiciary. But occasions do arise when a particular judge, without any justification, may cast aspersions on a witness or any other person not before him affecting the character of such witness or person. Such remarks may affect the reputation or even the career of such person. In my experience I find such cases are very rare. But if it happens, I agree with the Full Bench of the Bombay High Court that the appellate Court in a suitable case may judicially correct the observations of the lower Court by pointing out that the observations made by that Court were not justified or were without any foundation were wholly wrong or improper. This can be done under its inherent power preserved under section 561-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. But that power must be exercised only in exceptional cases where the interest of the Party concerned would irrevocably suffer. From the aforesaid discussion the followingprinciples emerge : (1) A judgment of a criminal Court is final ; it can be set aside or modified only in the manner prescribed by law. (2) Every judge, whatever may be his rank in the hierarchy, must have an unrestricted right to express his views in any matter before him without fear or favour. (3) There is a correlative and self-imposed duty in a judge not to make irrelevant remarks or observations without any foundation, especially in the case of witnesses or parties not before him, affecting their character or reputation. (4) An appellate Court has jurisdiction to judicially correct such remarks, but it will do so only in exceptional cases where such remarks would cause irrevocable harm to a witness or a party not before it. Let me now apply the said principles to the instant case. Here, a bail application was pending before the Magistrate on the ground that the accused were ill. The Magistrate asked the medical officer to report on their health. The said officer sent a report stating that he had examined the accused and that they were suffering from hookworm infection and were anaemic. In the statement of tile case the appellant says that he made a clinical examination and also the examination of the stools of the accused; but he did not send along with his report the result of his clinical examination showing the particulars of the blood and stool tests. The learned Munsif-Magistrate pointed out that no actual examination report was attached to the petition (report) and that it was an extreme case of carelessness on the part of the doctor concerned. The Magistrate felt that as a judicial officer he could not accept the mere ipsi dixit of the doctor unsupported by the results of clinical examination to come to a conclusion one way or other whether the accused were really so ill as to be let on bail. In the circumstances, if the Magistrate characterised the act of the medicial officer in not sending the detailed report asan act of extreme carelessness, can it be said that his inference was such that the appellate Court should treat it as an exceptional case and judicially correct the said observations? Indeed, the High Court in its. judgment said: \"The observation of the learned Munsif- Magistrate does not seem to be wholly unjusti- fied The doctor should have given the reasons for calling the accused person on whose behalf bail petitions were moved as anaemic.\" It rightly concluded thus : \"In the circumstances, if the Court said that the doctor was careless, I do not think that there is any impropriety in such an observation. It is likely that some other Court may take a different view of the thing, but that is no ground for upsetting the observations of a Court. To accept this contention would amount to placing unnecessary fetters on the discretion of the Court in assessing any witness or any evidence in course of its judgment or order.\" With these observations, it dismissed the petition. Now, the question is whether in such circumstances this Court in exercise of its powers under article 136 of the Constitution should interfere with the order of the High Court. Is it such an exceptional case which calls for the interference of this Court? The High Court in exercise of its discretion, for the reasons given by it, refused to expunge the remarks. It is certainly not a case meriting the interference of this Court in its extraordinary jurisdiction. That apart, I entirely agree with the observations of the High Court. A judicial officer does notsurrendar his judgment in medical matters to the ipsi dixit of the doctor. The opinion of a doctor has great weight, provided it is supported by the material on which he formed the opinion. If he does not disclose the particulars of the clinical results, how can the Court come to a conclusion that the accused were so ill as to be released on bail? In the circumstances, the Magistrate said that the doctor was grossly negligent. It is not possible to say that the said observation is either irrelevant or without foundation. In the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed. MUDHOLKAR J. In this appeal by special leave from a judgment of the High Court of Patna the question raised is as to the powers of the High Court under section 561-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure in regard to expunging remarks made in its judgment or order by a court against a person who is neither a party nor a witness to the proceeding. The question arises this way. A bail application was moved in the court of Mr. B. Rai, Munsif Magistrate,Jahanabad on behalf of two persons who were accused in a criminal case pending in that court on the ground that they were lying seriously ill in jail. On October 3, 1959 the Magistrate passed an order calling upon the Civil Assistant Surgeon at that place, who, we are told, is also Superintendent of the Sub-jail to report whether the accused persons are ill. On October 7, 1959. Mr. Sharan the Civil Assistant Surgeon, signing as the Superintendent of the Sub-jail submitted the following report : \"Ref : Copy of order sheet dated 3-10-1959 in G. R. 367/59 Ghosi P. S. case 3 (8)/59. Sir, Examined accused Ramsewak Dusadh and Ramdeo Dusadh both sons of Dillan Dusadh of village Havellipur P. S. Ghosi, district Gaya and found that both of them are suffering from hookworm infections and are anaemic. Yours faithfully, Sd/ x x x \" The report was addressed to the Magistrate. On October 19, 1959 he passed his order releasing the accused persons on bail, in the course of which he made certain observations which are sought to be expunged. For some obscure reason the learned magistrate has regarded what is plainly a report to be a 'Petition' and then blamed Dr. Sharan for not realising that a judicial order could be passed only on his report and not \"his petition\". That is not all. He has found fault with Dr. Sharan because (a) the report appeared to be in the handwriting of some person other than himself and was only signed by him and (b) \"'no actual examination report was attached with this petition (sic)\". For these reasons he observed in his order : \"It is an extreme case of carelessness on the part of the Doctor concerned\" and ordered that a copy of the 'petition' and the order sheet be sent to the Civil Surgeon, Gaya for information. The report of Dr. Sharan is couched in the usual form but if the Magistrate felt any doubt about the matter he could well have sought to have it cleared by writing to him for particulars. No doubt, this might have entailed postponment of the case and thus delayed passing an order. But it would seem that the Magistrate did not really think that the report was inadequate. For, acting upon it, he in fact released the accused persons on bail on the very day, that is October 19. All this is, however, very trivial and is not a kind of matter which ought ever to have been brought up before this Court. No doubt the learnedMagistrate has said that the doctor was careless and by forwarding a copy of the order straight to his departmental superior indicated that he expected action to be taken on the basis of his remarks.But in view of the fact that the learned Magistrate had in fact acted upon the doctor's report and had wrongly characterised it as a petition his remarks could not reasonably have been regarded by the doctor's superiors as being very serious. No harm, much less any irreparable harm, could therefore be expected to result from these remarks. Upon this view we would not have said anything further. But, Mr. D. P. Singh, appearing for the State of Bihar has raised an objection to the jurisdiction of the High Court under section 561-A of the Code and since it raises a question of general importance, it is necessary to deaf with it. That section reads thus : \"Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent power of the High Court to make such orders as may be -necessary to give effect to any order under this Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.\" This provision was introduced in the Code when it was extensively amended in the year 1923. But it does not confer and was not intended to confer any new powers on the High Courts. The courts exist not only for securing obedience to the law of the land but also for securing the ends of justice in its widest sense. All courts, including the High Courts, can exercise such powers as the laws of the land confer upon them as well as such inherent powers to do justice as are preserved expressly or are not taken away by a statute. We shall confine ourselves to the inherent powers of the High Court in criminal cases. Now, section 561-A says in clear terms that the inherent power of the High Court to do certain things ispreserved and what we have to ascertain is whether the power to expunge any passage from the judgment of a subordinate court is inherent in the High Court and must, therefore, be deemed to have been preserved. The power of the High Court to expunge remarks from the judgment or order of a subordinate court while dealing with an appeal from that court is not questioned by Mr. Singh. In fact expunction of remarks was ordered by this Court in appeal in The State of U. P. v. J. N. Bagga (1), but there is no discussion in the judgment on the point, as the exis- tence of the power was not challenged. We are not concerned here with the powers of the appellate court. The question before us is whether the inherent power of the High Court to secure the ends of justice embraces the power to expunge passages from the judgment of a subordinate court which is independent of its statutory powers to alter, amend or reverse the judgments of subordinate courts in appeals or revisions before it. Observations made by a subordinate court in its judgment or order may very seriously affect, in a given case, only a party thereto in which event he can, if the observations are irrelevant or unjustifiable, seek redress by appeal or revision, whichever of the remedies is available to him at law. But what if a stranger to the proceeding or a lawyer engaged in the case is affected by the court's remarks of a similar character? Has he no remedy? Must he suffer the consequences of irrelevant or unjustifiable remarks of a court though if similar remarks were made against a party to the proceeding that party is entitled to seek redress? It would be a travesty of justice if an injured stranger to a proceeding should have to suffer unheard as a result of unjustifiable and harmful observations made by a court against him. The case of an injured stranger would be of a kind in (1) Criminal . A. number 122 of 1959 decided on January 16, 1961.which redress would be possible only if some court possesses such power and can exercise it to secure the ends of justice. The question is whether the highest court in a State has and must always be deemed to have had such power. The further question is whether the exercise of such power would involve alteration of a judgment or order and if so whether that must be deemed to have been permitted by the Code. Certain cases were cited at the Bar and we will deal with them in chronological order. The first is In the matter of H. Daly (1). In that case Tek Chand J., said that the High Court has power to expunge passages from judgments delivered by itself or by subordinate courts and its power to do so has been put beyond controversy by the enactment of section 561-A in the Code of Criminal Procedure. While coming to this conclusion the learned judge has referred to five decisions of the Chief Court of Lahore and pointed out that that court claimed the power to expunge remarks in appropriate cases. It may incidentally be mentioned that he has also referred to the decision in Panchanan Banerjee v. Upendra Nath (2), in which it was held that the High Court had inherent power to order deletion of passages which are either irrelevant or inadmissible and which adversely affect the character of persons before the Court. It may, however, be mentioned that that was a case where the learned judge, Suleiman J. was dealing with an appeal against acquittal and ordered the expunction of remarks while exercising appellate jurisdic tion though he has referred in this connection to the inherent powers of the court. Neither of these decisions, however, contains any discussion upon that point. Then there is the decision in Rogers v. Shriniwas Gopal Kawale (3), in which Beaumont C. J. (1) (1927) I.L.R. 9 Lah, 269. (2) (1926) I.L.R. 49 All. 254, (3) I.L.R. (1940) Bom. 415,held that the High Court had no power under section 561-A to expunge passages in judgments which have not been brought before it in regular appeal or revision. There, an application was made under section 561-A for expunging certain observations criticising a witness made by the Additional Sessions judge of Poona in a criminal appeal. Dealing with the application the learned Chief justice observed : \"It is obvious that, if the jurisdiction exists, its exercise must place the Court in an anomalous position. The Court must go though the record of a case in which it is not called upon to act judicially at the instance of a party who is not aggrieved by the decision, and it may well be that the Court will have to come to a conclusion upon matters not in issue in the proceedings.\" He referred to the decision in Emperor v. C. Dunn and Emperor v. Sidaramaya (2), in the first of which it was held that the High Court had no such jurisdiction and in the second it was said that it was doubtful whether such jurisdiction exists in the High Court. He expressed disagreement with the view taken in Panchanan Banerjee's case (3) and Daly's case (4) and observed : \"With all respect to the learned judges who have taken a different view, I am quite unable to see how section 561A affects the question. That section provides that nothing in the Code shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent power of the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. So that all that the section does is to preserve the inherent powers of the High Court without conferring any additional power. In my opinion no Court can claim (1) (1922) 44 All. 401. (3) (1926) I.L.R. 49 AD. 254. (2) (1917) 19 Bom. L.R. 912. (4) (1927) I.L.R. 9 Lah. 269. inherent power to alter the judgment of an- other Court. All powers in appeal and revision are statutory and not inherent in the superior Court. When once a matter is duly brought before a superior Court, then no doubt inherent powers may be called in aid to enable the Court to do complete justice, but the power to bring a matter in appeal or revision before a superior Court must be conferred by statute or some enactment having statutory effect.\" The learned Chief justice observed that the power of superintendence conferred upon the High Court by section 224 of the Government of India Act over Courts subordinate to it does not enable the High Court to correct a judgment of a subordinate court and pointed out that ss. 435 and 439 Criminal . P.C. only enable the High Court to satisfy itself about the correctness, legality or propriety of any finding, sentence or order of an inferior court or of the regularity of the proceeding before it. Then he observed : \"When the High Court is hearing an application in appeal or revision, the whole matter is before it and it can make any order conse- quential or incidental to the order under review and in my opinion, in such a case the Court is entitled to expunge any remarks in the lower Court's judgment which it thinks ought not to have been made. But it seems to be impossible to say that expunging passages from a judgment giving reasons for an order which is not under appeal involves anything consequential or incidental to the matter in appeal. If the Court thinks that any such 'action is called for, it can itself send for the record and act regularly in revision.\" In the end the learned Chief justice held that the decision in Emperor v. Dunn (1), was right and has not been altered by the introduction of section 561-A, (1) (1922) 44 AU. 401. This judgment was partially overruled by a Full Bench in State v. Nilkanth Shripad Bhave Chagl a C. who delivered the judgment of the court concurred with the observation of Beaumont C. J.,that no court can claim inherent power to alter the judgment of another court and after pointing out that Beaumont C.J., had also said in his judgment that the Court had inherent jurisdiction to alter the judgment once the matter comes before it in appeal or revision, said : \"It is difficult to understand, if the High Court has no inherent jurisdiction to alter the judgment of another Court, how that jurisdiction arises merely because the matter comes before the High Court in appeal or revision. Either the Court has inherent jurisdiction or it has not. If it has inherent jurisdiction, it can be exercised either in appeal or in revision, or, section 561-A.\" The learned Chief Justice then quoted the further observations of Beaumont C. J., Which we have reproduced earlier and said : \"It is difficult to understand how the Court can act regularly in revision if there is no effective order which can be challenged in revision. Therefore, in our opinion this judgment was correctly decided to the extent that it laid down that there was no inherent jurisdiction in a superior Court to alter the judgment of another Court. But to the extent that this Division Bench laid down that the power to judicially correct the judgment of a lower Court only arose in appeals and revisions it was not correctly decided. The power of the High Court judicially to correct any subordinate judge exists independently of applications which come before it by way of (1) I.L.R. (1954) Bom.148. appeal or revision. This Court can judicially correct any subordinate judge in any application made to it which it can entertain under S. 561-A of the Court.\" The learned Chief justice then referred to an unreported decision of the Bombay High Court in which the view was taken that the Court has jurisdiction to expunge remarks from the judgment of a lower court although the matter was not before it in appeal or revision and in which the Court expressed difficulty in appreciating the view taken in Roger's case (1). Then the learned Chief justice pointed out that be did not find it easy to understand how if, as was said by Beaumont C. J., the power to alter the judgment of an inferior 'Court is not an inherent power, it can be brought in aid as an inherent power provided only the matter is before the High Court, in what he has called regular revision. According to the learned Chief Justice in entertaining an application under section 561-A \"what the High Court should do is not to expunge remarks but judicially to correct by its judgment the judgment of the lower Court.\" We also find it difficult to understand what Beaumont C.J. meant when he said on the one hand that the if High Court has no inherent power to alter the judgment of an inferior court and on the other that when the matter is before the High Court by way of regular revision it can alter the judgment by exercising its inherent power. Either the High Court has inherent power to alter a judg- ment of a subordinate court or it has not. If it has no inherent power to do so 'the mere fact that a regular proceeding arising out of the judgment of the subordinate court is before it would make no difference. For, even then it cannot do anything as its revisional powers under section 439 Criminal . P. C. do not enable it to expunge remarks. Yet, according to the learned Chief justice, the High Court can then exercise its inherent power. How it can do so when on the (1) I.L.R. (1940) Rom, 415. earlier statement of the legal position, it has no such inherent power, is not easy to follow. We also feel some difficulty in understanding the judgment of Chagla C.J. when he says that by entertaining an application under section 561 -A the High Court can judicially correct the judgment of a subordinate court but at the same time not expunge remarks therein as doing so would be altering the judgment of the subordinate court. If the alteration or amendment of the judgment or order of a subordinate court is not the necessary consequence of the judicial correction of such judgment or order we fail to see how removing from it a passage which is not relevant to the controversy decided by the judgment would amount to such alteration. A judgment consists of the verdict of the court and its reasons bearing on it. If a superior court supersedes or alters or amends either of these it will be reversing, altering or amending the judgment. But if a document embodying the judgment contains besides the court's verdict and reasons therefor, any additional matter which is unrelated to either of these two components of the judgment it cannot properly be regarded as a part of the judgment merely because it is contained in the same document. By including within the judgment irrelevant matter the court cannot make them an integral part of the judgment. The power to delete or order the deletion of such matter for securing the ends of justice must be deemed to inhere in the High Court. The learned Chief justice seems to accept the position that under section 561-A an application can be made to the High Court complaining of injurious remarks by a subordinate court on the ground that they are unjustifiable or irrelevant and that such an application becomes a judicial proceeding before the High Court. He also accepts that the High Court can thereupon correct the judgment of the subordinate court in appropriate circumstances. If the High court has power in such a proceeding to correct the judgment or order of a subordinate court how exactly and when does it exercise it ? Earlier in his judgment the learned Chief justice has said : \"A judgment of a lower court may be wrong; it may even be perverse. The proper way to attack that judgment is by bringing it under the scrutiny of the superior Court and getting the judgment of the lower Court judicially corrected. But is it proper for the superior Court to alter or amend the judgment which has already been delivered ? In our opinion, the inherent power that the High Court possesses is, in proper cases, even though no appeal or revision may be preferred to this Court, to judicially correct the observations of the lower Court by pointing out that the observa- tions 'Made by the Magistrate were riot justi- fied or were without any foundation or were wholly wrong or improper.\" It may be mentioned that the Advocate-General who appeared in the case had urged that merely making observations of this kind or passing strictures on a subordinate court stands on a different footing from expunging objectionable remarks. The learned Chief justice observed : \"In our opinion it is not necessary to express the displeasure of this Court against any observations made by a Magistrate or by a Sessions judge by expunging the remarks from the judgment delivered by him. x x x x In our opinion, therefore., it would not be correct to say that expunging remarks from a judgment or deleting passages from a judgment constitutes the inherent power of any superior Court and, therefore, the inherent power of the High Court.\"The learned Chief justice quite rightly holds that the High Court has inherent power judicially to correct a subordinate court even for making harmful remarks against a person who is not a party to the proceedings. But, according to him, the sole content of this power consists of expression by the superior court of its displeasure at the offending remarks. We can discern no principle upon which such a limitation on the inherent powers of the High Court can be justified. Moreover, mere expression by the High Court of its displeasure at the offending observations of a subordinate court cannot even be regarded as amounting to \"judical correction\" of the error committed by such Court. For, despite the disapprobation, the remarks continue to be there on the record of the subordinate court. The form normally adopted by a superior court for \"judicial correction\" of an error of a subordinate court does not consist of mere expression of its disagreement with the view taken by the subordinate court but of effacing that error and thus depriving it of its legal effect. That is precisely what ought to be done with respect to irrelevant remarks of a subordinate court when they are found to be unjustifiable and harmful. The appropriate form in which this part of the judicial process may be carried out would be either by ex- punging them or directing them to be expunged so that they would cease to have any effect. There can be no doubt that the judgment of a tribunal empowered by law to adjudicate upon and decide any matter affecting the rights of parties is inviolable unless the law allows it to be questioned or interfered with. In such a case the judgment can be challenged only and interfered with only by the specified authority and to the extent permissible by the express provisions of law. No other court, not even the High Court, unless expressly permitted bylaw can entertain a challenge or exercise any power with respect to a judgment. Its inherent power is not exerciseable for this purpose because what is made final or inviolable by law is beyond the purview of such power. But the inviolability which attaches to a judgment must necessarily be confined to its integral parts, that is the verdict and reasons therefor. It cannot extend to matters which though ostensibly a part of the judgment are not in reality its integral parts. It is because of this that the majority of the High Courts hold that they have always had the power to expunge passages from the judgments of subordinate courts in certain circumstances. In other words that this power has always been there and can be resorted to for securing the ends of justice. It is significant to note that despite this, though the Code was amended materially in 1955 the legislature did not indicate in section 561-A or any other provision that this power did not exist or is taken away. Clearly the High Courts, by expunging remarks from an order or judgment of a subordinate court, would not in any event be altering it on merits or in any matter of substance but be only deleting from it matter which being alien to the matter before the court ought never to have been there. When such only is the effect of what the High Court does, can prohibition to this court be inferred from the fact that ss. 423 and 439, which deal with appellate and revisional powers, are silent about such matters? We are clear that they do not exclude such power. As already stated, expunction of irrelevant remarks does not amount to the alteration or amendment of a judgment or an order of a subordinate court. No doubt, the exercise of such power will have the effect of taking out of the judgment or order something which was there before and thus in a limited way to interference with the content of the document embodying the judgment or order."}, "annotations": [{"result": [{"value": {"start": 0, "end": 66, "text": "CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION Criminal Appeal number 87 of 1961.", "labels": ["NONE"]}}, {"value": {"start": 67, "end": 205, "text": "Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated October 7, 1960 of the Patna High Court in Criminal Revision number 460 of 1960.", "labels": ["NONE"]}}, {"value": {"start": 206, "end": 278, "text": "B.

From the Judgment and Order dated 8-4-1969 of the Allahabad High Court in First Appeal number 45/55. Mrs. Rani Chhabra for the Appellant. B. N. Dikshit, O. P. Rana and Mrs. Shobha Dikshit for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by FAZAL ALI, J.-This appeal by certificate is directed against a judgment dated January 6, 1969 of the Allahabad High Court and arises in the following circumstances. The land in dispute originally belonged to Shrimati Jawahar Devi who had inherited the same from her father Shankar Das who died sometime in or before the year 1905. Jawahar Devi had a daughter Putli Bibi who had three sons, namely, Basantlal, Shankarlal and Girdharilal. Jawahar Devi died in the year 1934. On the 25th February 1905, Jawahar Devi let out the land to the late Lala Lachman Das for the construction of a mill which was known as 'Narain Das Lachman Das Oil Mill'. The lease was to continue for 50 years and contained a clause for renewal. In the year 1936-37, the lessee Lachman Das transferred his rights in the lease to Northern India Oil Industries Limited (hereinafter referred to as the 'Company'). Thereafter, the three sons of Putli Bibi sent a notice on the 15th of December 1937 to M/section Narain Dass Lachman Dass claiming damages. At that stage Girdharilal sold his rights in the land to his brother Basant Lal. In the year 1938, a suit was filed by Basantlal and Shankarlal against M/section Narain Dass Lachman Dass as well as the Company. This suit was, however, compromised on the 2nd of June 1941 and on the same date a fresh lease was executed by the two plaintiffs therein in favour of the company. The terms of the lease were incorporated in the compromise (Exhibit 31) but both the lease and the compromise were contained in unregistered documents. Disputes again arose between the parties and led to the institution of a suit by the company against Basantlal and Shankarlal for specific performance of the compromise above mentioned (Exhibit 31). This suit also ended on the 26th of May 1943 in a compromise according to which a fresh lease embodying the terms of the lease dated the 2nd June 1941 was to be executed by Basantlal and Shankarlal in favour of the Company and at its cost within a week provided the company complied with the covenants contained in that lease to the satisfaction of Rai Bahadur Lala Ram Narain, Treasurer, Imperial Bank of India, Kanpur. Despite the second compromise disputes again cropped up between the parties and ultimately Basantlal and Shankarlal, who are the appellants before us, sent to the company a notice dated 26th of February 1944 (Exhibit 36-A) terminating the lease dated the 2nd June 1941 on the ground of breach by the company of covenants 2, 4 and 5 contained therein. Time was allowed to the company till the 30th June 1944 for the removal of machinery, stores, buildings and other constructions. The Company, however, secured an order from a civil court forbidding the appellants from ejecting it. On the 7th June 1946, the Company applied to the State Government for compulsory acquisition of the land. Its request was accepted and the land covered by the lease was acquired by the Government for the purpose of the company. In proceedings before the Collector the appellants claimed compensation not only for the land but also for the buildings and other structures standing thereon. Compensation for the land was awarded to them but the rest of their claim was turned down. The matter was re-agitated before the District Judge to whom it was referred and then in appeal before the High Court. The District Judge and the High Court raised the quantum of compensation for the land but rejected the claim of the appellants for compensation in respect of buildings and structures. In the appeal before us no dispute subsists about the compensation for the land and the controversy is limited to the compensation for the buildings, etc., which were constructed on the premises by the lessee and to which the appellants claim title on the ground that the company did not remove the same despite a period of more than 4 months granted to it for the purpose in the notice dated the 26th of February 1944 and that the title thereto had consequently vested in the appellants with effect from 1st July 1944. Before proceeding further we may recapitulate the manner in which the present dispute was dealt with by the two Courts below. It was argued before the District Judge on behalf of the State that the lease dated the 2nd June 1941 being unregistered it was inadmissible in evidence and that the Company, therefore, was not bound to vacate the premises. The District Judge overruled the argument (and in our opinion rightly) on the ground that the terms of the lease formed part of the decree based on compromise Exhibit 31, that the compromise related to the property which was the subject-matter of the suit and that, therefore, the compromise did not require registration. The argument was repeated before the High Court and was rejected for the same reason for which it was repelled by the District Judge. Another point taken before the District Judge was that as the appellants had accepted the rent after having given the notice dated February 26, 1944, their conduct in doing so amounted to waiver of the notice as a result of which the tenancy continued to subsist. The District Judge accepted this point and non-suited the appellants mainly on this ground. The High Court, however, did not agree with the conclusion of the District Judge and held that, in the first place, there was no evidence to show that the rent was accepted at any time after the notice was given to the company, and, secondly, as the rent was accepted by the appellants under protest, it could not amount to waiver because there was no intention on the part of the lessor to treat the lease as subsisting. In this connection, the High Court observed as follows:- \"We have been taken through the deposition of Basant Lal, but we have failed to find anything in that statement which may go to show that rent for the period beginning after the termination of the lease was accepted by him. All that he said was as follows:- \"Rent was sent to me and I accepted some rent under protest.\" \"From that statement, it cannot be said that the rent so accepted was for the period after termination of the lease. There is another sentence in the statement of Basant Lal, which reads as follows:- \"'I treated the defendant as trespasser from 26th February 1944 and accepted payment for use and occupation of the land.'\" \"The learned District Judge, therefore, was not right in taking the view that the notice was waived.\" We find ourselves in complete agreement with the view taken by the High Court. There is no reliable evidence at all to show the exact date when the rent was accepted or, at any rate, the fact that the rent was accepted between the 26th February 1944, when the notice was sent, and the 30th June 1944, when the Company was asked to vacate the premises. Furthermore, the High Court has pointed out from the evidence of the appellants that the Company was treated as a trespasser ever since 26th February 1944, namely, the date when the notice was given and has held that any rent which the appellants accepted was really not rent but mere compensation for wrongful use and occupation of the land. In these circumstances, we fully endorse the finding of the High Court that there was no waiver of the notice such as was spelt by the District Judge. The High Court, however, upheld the order of the District Judge for a different reason which was that there could not be any forfeiture of the tenancy under section 111(g) of the Transfer of Property Act unless a notice was given to the lessee by the lessor expressing his intention to terminate the lease and in addition a notice under s.114-A of that Act also affording an opportunity to the lessee to comply with the terms, the non-compliance of which would result in forfeiture. According to the High Court, as the second condition was not complied with, there was no forfeiture and hence the title to the structures, etc., continued to vest in the lessee and therefore after the Government acquired the land under the Land Acquisition Act, the appellants were not entitled to any compensation for the structures and the materials as claimed by them. We are, however, unable to agree with the view taken by the High Court for the reasons that we shall give hereafter. It is no doubt true that section 114-A of the Transfer of Property Act requires two conditions to be fulfilled before a suit for ejectment could lie-(1) that a notice should be given to the lessee specifying the particular breach complained of, and (2) that the lessee should be called upon to remedy the breach. If these conditions are fulfilled, then alone the lessor would be entitled to bring a suit for ejectmentof the lessee. In the instant case, it is no doubt common ground that in the notice dated February 26, 1944 the appellants did not at all mention that the lessee should remedy the breach within a reasonable period to be fixed by the lessor, but that does not advance the case of the lessee because s.114-A merely bars a suit for ejectment of the lessee. In the instant case, as the land had been acquired for the purpose of the lessee, viz., the Company, the question of filing a suit for ejectment did not arise at all. In fact, the lessees themselves filed a suit and obtained an injunction restraining the appellants from ejecting them before the land acquisition proceedings were taken in respect of the land in dispute. Thus, the non- compliance of sub-section (b) of s.114-A is of no consequence so far as this particular case is concerned. In the lease dated 2nd June, 1941, clause (6) clearly lays down that within four months after the expiry of the period of the lease the lessee would be entitled to remove the stocks and machinery. The last part of that clause also empowers the lessor to re-enter possession and acquire title to the buildings, etc., that may be constructed by the lessee. Mr. Dixit, appearing for the State of U.P., relied on s.108(h) of the Transfer of Property Act which runs thus: \"108(h). The lessee may even after the determination of the lease remove, at any time whilst he is in possession of the property leased, but not afterwards, all things which he has attached to the earth, provided he leaves the property in the State in which he received it.\" He contended that even if the lease was determined, the title to the construction, etc., would vest in the lessor only if the lessee does not remove the materials at any time whilst he is in possession of the property leased. It was argued that in the instant case, as the leased land was acquired by the Government while the lessee was still in possession and continued to be in possession, by virtue of the land having been acquired, the lessor could not claim any title to the constructions or the materials. There could be no doubt that this is the real effect of clause (h) of s. 108 but section 108 opens with a sort of a non-obstante clause which is as follows: \"In the absence of a contract or local usage to the contrary, the lessor and the lessee of immovable property, as against one another, respectively, possess the rights and are subject to the liabilities mentioned in the rules next following, or such of them as are applicable to the property leased.\" A construction of this clause clearly reveals that where there is a contract to the contrary the provisions of s.108(h) would not apply. In the lease dated June 2, 1941, there is not only an express clause under which the lessee was entitled to remove the stocks and materials within four months after the termination of the lease but thereafter there was another stipulation that in case the lessee failed to do so, all the buildings, etc., would become the property of the lessor. In this connection, the relevant part of the lease may be extracted thus:- \"6. That within four months after the expiry of the period of lease, the lessees, their successors or assigns will be entitled to remove their stocks and machinery etc. pipelines, electric installation, fixtures, fittings, including stocks and materials of their constructions and fittings which stand on the plot of land shown by the letters A F H G in the accompanying map and will, on the expiry at the period of lease have over to the lessors the said plot of land (shown by letters A F H G in the accompanying map) duly levelled but the lessees would not be entitled to remove the boundary walls or any constructions or buildings which at present are created, which may be created during the period of lease on the plot of land shown by letters A B E F in the accompanying map and which is outside the compound of the lessees Oil Mills on the eastern side and on which at present stand twenty three quarters facing Hamirpur Road, as their quarters or any other buildings that may be created in their place or on their site as well as boundary walls would become the property of the lessors on the expiry of the period of lease, without any compensation being paid for the same by the lessors to the lessees.\" (Emphasis ours) Thus, although the lessee continued to remain in the premises after the expiry of the notice terminating the lease, yet by force of the express recitals in clause(6) extracted above, the buildings, etc., became the property of the lessors. Unfortunately, this aspect of the matter does not appear to have been considered by the High Court. In these circumstances, therefore, the conclusion is inescapable that after the Government acquired the property it was bound to pay compensation to the appellants not only for the land but also for the buildings and structures thereon. As, however, neither of the Courts below have assessed the compensation for the buildings, etc., as they stood in the year 1946 when the land was acquired, the matter will have to be determined by the District Judge afresh in so far as such compensation is concerned. We would, therefore, allow this appeal with costs, set aside the Judgments of the High Court and the District Judge in so far as no compensation has been awarded in respect of the buildings, structures, etc., and remand the case to the District Judge for determining such compensation according to the rates prevailing in 1946 and also to determine the interest and solatium to be paid on such compensation from 1946 upto the date of payment.

From the Judgment and order dated 16.5.1980 of the Patna High Court in Writ Jurisdiction Case number 1430 of 1979. S.R. Srivastava for the Appellant. D. Goburdhan and A. Sharan, for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SEN, J. This appeal by special leave is against the judgment and order of the Patna High Court dated 16th May, 1980 allowing the writ petition filed by respondent number 4 Dr. Kameshwar Prasad and quashing the impugned advertisement number 121/1978 issued by the Bihar Public Service Commission inviting applications for the post of Deputy Director (Homeopathic) in the Directorate of Indigenous Medicines, Health Department, State of Bihar from scheduled caste candidates, and the consequent order of the State Government dated 30th May, 1979 for the appointment of the appellant Dr. Chakradhar Paswan to that post. A few essential facts would elucidate the nature of the controversy. Prior to 1974 the Directorate of Indigenous Systems of Medicines was a part of the Health Department. On 14th March, 1974 the State Government appointed Dr. Nagesh Dwivedi, Manager, State Ayurvedic and Unani Medical Pharmacy, Bihar on an ad-hoc basis to the post of Director (Indigenous Medicines). He assumed charge on the next day and was confirmed in that post on 11th December, 1976. The State Government on 6th May, 1978 directed the creation of a separate Directorate of Indigenous Medicines, the Director being from one of the systems of medicines consisting of Ayurvedic, Unani and Homeopathic. At the time of creation of the separate Directorate,the Government sanctioned the posts of two Deputy Directors for each of the two remaining systems. The State Government had in the meanwhile on the basis of the decision of this Court in M.R. Balaji & ORS v. State of Mysore, [ 1963] Suppl. 1 SCR 439 by its circular dated 8th November, 1975 prescribed a 50 point roster to implement the policy of reservation to posts and appointments for members of the backward classes under article 16(4). It was laid down that 'if in any grade, there is only one vacancy for the first time, then it will be deemed to be unreserved and for the second time also, if there be only one vacancy, then it will be deemed to be reserved'. Acting upon the roster the Joint Secretary to the Government, General Administration Department (Personal) made a proposal on 13th June, 1978 for reservation of the post of Deputy Director (Homeopathic) for members of the scheduled castes. He said that in the Directorate of Indigenous Medicines, three posts had been sanctioned-(1) Director of Indigenous Medicines (2) Deputy Director (Homeopathic) and (3) Deputy Director (Unani). All these posts were Class I posts. He suggested that according to the roster of appointments, out of these three posts the first, namely, that of Director which had been filled by Dr. Nagesh Dwivedi, be treated as unreserved, the second should be treated as a reserved for a scheduled caste candidates and the third should be unreserved. According to him, all the posts could be grouped together from the view-point of reservation. After the qualifications had been prescribed in consultation with Dr. Jugal Kishore, Advisor to the Government, the Health Minister passed an order on 28th July, 1978 for the reservation of the post of Deputy Director (Homeopathic) for a scheduled caste candidate. The Public Service Commission on being moved by the Government, issued the impugned advertisement inviting applications from members of the scheduled castes and the appellant was selected for appointment to the post. Apprehending that the Government would appoint the appellant to the post, respondent number 4 moved the High Court by a petition under article 226 of the Constitution for the grant of an appropriate writ, direction or order. The Government however by order dated 30th May, 1979 appointed the appellant to the post of Deputy Director (Homeopathic) and he assumed charge to that post, and was later confirmed in the post. Although the appointment of the appellant has been declared to be invalid by the High Court, he is continuing to hold the post by virtue of the interim stay granted by this Court on 26th June, 1980. It appears that steps were thereafter taken to fill up the post of Deputy Director (Unani) and Dr. Mohammad Kamruzzama Kamar, Pradhyapak, Government Tibbia College, Patna was promoted andappointed to that post, and he is working on regular basis. On 5th October, 1982 the Government sanctioned the additional post of Deputy Director (Ayurvedic) and this post was filled up by promotion of Dr. (Shrimati ) Uma Sinha, who is holding additional charge of the post in addition to the charge of her own post as Pradhyapak, Government Ayurvedic College, Patna. Thus, in the Directorate of Indigenous Medicines for the present there are four posts, all being Class I posts. Out of these, the post of Deputy Director (Homeopathic) is held by the appellant who belongs to a scheduled caste, and the remaining three posts including the post of Director are held by members belonging to the general category Lalit Mohan Sharma, J. speaking for a Division Bench held that (1) Reservation to the only post of Deputy Director (Homeopathic) for members belonging to the scheduled castes is tantamount to 100% reservation. (2) The two posts of Deputy Director (Homeopathic) and Deputy Director (Ayurvedic) cannot be linked together for purposes of reservation of posts. And (3) The order reserving the post of Deputy Director (Homeopathic) infringes the principle embodied in the Government circular introducing 50 point roster according to which, if in a particular cadre, a single post falls vacant, it should, in the case of first vacancy, be considered as general and on the second occasion when a single post again falls vacant, the same must be treated as reserved. The learned Judge also said that it has been laid down that if in a particular cadre there is only one post, then in case when it is being filled up for the second time, it will be considered reserved, that is, on the first occasion it must be treated as a general seat. In substance, the High Court was of the view that the posts of Director and three Deputy Directors could not be clubbed together for reservation of posts and appointments. Nor could the posts of Deputy Directors of Homeopathic, Ayurvedic and Unani which form distinct and separate systems of medicines be grouped for purposes of reservation. The main contention of Dr. Y.S. Chitale, learned counsel for the appellant, is that there are four posts in the Directorate of Indigenous Medicines and all the posts are Class I posts and therefore according to the 50 point roster, the post of Director having been treated as unreserved, by the rotational system, the post of Deputy Director (Homeopathic) was rightly reserved for a scheduled caste candidate. According to him, the High Court fell into an error in assuming that the reservation of the post of Deputy Director (Homeopathic) for a scheduled caste candidate under article 16(4) amounted to 100% reser-vation and suffered from the vice of offending against the equality clause under article 16(1) read with article 14 of the Constitution. In answer to the argument Shri L.N. Sinha, learned counsel appearing for respondent number 4, submits that firstly, the posts of Director and Deputy Directors are not carried in the same cadre and therefore they could not be grouped for purposes of implementing the policy of reservation under article 16(4), and secondly, the three systems of indigenous medicines, namely, Homeopathic, Ayurvedic and Unani are distinct and separate systems of medicines and thus the 50 point roster could not be applied. As we had doubt and difficulty as to whether the posts of Director and Deputy Directors were Posts belonging to the same cadre, we called upon the parties to file further and better affidavits to elucidate the point. The State Government has now placed on record the additional affidavit of the Law officer in the Health Department, State of Bihar dated 10th November, 1987. The affidavit discloses certain facts, namely: (1) The pay scale of Director of Indigenous Medicines is different from that of the Deputy Directors. (2) The posts of the Deputy Director (Homeopathic), Deputy Director (Ayurvedic) and Deputy Director (Unani) are carried in the pay scale of Rupees 1900-75-2500. (3) Although the pay scale of all the three Deputy Directors is identical, the posts are filled by doctors belonging to different branches of indigenous medicines, namely, Homeopathic, Ayurvedic and Unani. (4) The post of Director is the highest post in the Directorate of Indigenous Medicines and the said post is in the higher pay scale of Rupees 2225-75-2675. (5) Though the posts of Director and Deputy Directors in the Directorate do not belong to unified grade, but for the purpose of determining the quantum of reservation the three posts i.e. that of the Director, Deputy Director (Homeopathic), and Deputy Director (Unani) were grouped together as all of them were Class I posts. (6) The newly-created post of Deputy Director (Ayurvedic) which at present is vacant is being filled up by following the principle of 50 point roster. These facts are not controverted by the appellant by any affidavit-in-rejoinder. The questions that fall for our determination are: (1) Is the post of Deputy Director (Homeopathic) an 'isolated post' and therefore reservation of the post for a scheduled caste candidate amounts to 100% reservation and must therefore be declared to be impermissible under article 16(4)? (2) Whether the posts of the Director and the three Deputy Directors could be grouped together for purposes of implementing the policy of reservation, according to the 50 point roster.And (3) Could the posts of the Director and the three Deputy Directors in. the Directorate of Indigenous Medicines although they are posts carried on different grades, still be clubbed together for purposes of reservation merely because they are Class I posts? The argument of learned counsel for the appellant suffers from the infirmity that it overlooks that though the Directorate of Indigenous Medicines comprises of four posts, namely, that of the Director and three Deputy Directors, which are Class I posts, the posts of Director and Deputy Directors do not constitute one 'cadre'. They are members of the same Service but do not belong to the same cadre. According to the 50 point roster, if in a particular grade a single post falls vacant, it should, in the case of first vacancy, be considered as unreserved i.e. general and on the second occasion when a single post again falls vacant, the same must be treated as reserved. Admittedly, the post of the Director is the highest post in the Directorate of Indigenous Medicines and is carried in the higher pay scale or grade of Rupees 2225-75-2675 while the posts of the Deputy Directors are carried in the pay scale of grade of Rupees 1900- 75-2500. In service jurisprudence, the term 'cadre' has a definite legal connotation. In the legal sense, the word 'cadre' is not synonymous with 'service'. Fundamental Rule 9(4) defines the word 'cadre' to mean the strength of a service or part of a service sanctioned as a separate unit. The post of the Director which is the highest post in the directorate, is carried on a higher grade or scale, while the posts of Deputy Directors are borne in a lower grade or scale and therefore constitute two distinct cadres or grades. It is open to the Government to constitute as many cadres in any particular service as it may choose according to the administrative convenience and expediency and it cannot be said that the establishment of the Directorate constituted the formation of a joint cadre of the Director and the Deputy Directors because the posts are not interchangeable and the incumbents do not perform the same duties, carry the same responsibilities or draw the same pay. The conclusion is irresistible that the posts of the Director and those of the Deputy Directors constitute different cadres of the Service. It is manifest that the post of the Director of Indigenous Medicine, which is the highest post in the Directorate carried on a higher grade or scale, could not possibly be equated with those of the Deputy Directors on a lower grade or scale. In view of this, according to the 50 point roaster, if in a particular cadre a single post falls vacant, it should, in the case of first vacancy, be considered as general. That being so, the State Government could not have directed reservation of the post of Deputy Director (Homeopathic) which was the first vacancy in a particular cadre i.e.that of the Deputy Directors, for candidates belonging to the scheduled castes. Such reservation was not in conformity with the principles laid down in the 50 point roster and was impermissible under article 16(4) of the Constitution and clearly violative of the guarantee enshrined in article 16(1) of equal opportunity to all citizens relating to public employment. Clause (4) of article 16 is by way of an exception of the proviso to article 16(1). The High Court rightly held that the reservation of the post of Deputy Director (Homeopathic) amounted to 100% reservation which was impermissible under article 16(4) as otherwise it would render the guarantee of equal opportunity in the matter of public employment under article 16(1) wholly elusive and meaningless. Another serious infirmity in the argument of the learned counsel for the appellant is that it overlooks the basic principle that if there is only one post in the cadre, there can be no reservation under article 16(4) of the Constitution. The whole concept of reservation for application of the 50 point roster is that there are more then one posts, and the reservation as laid down by this Court in M.R. Balaji's case can be upto 50%. The Government cannot, for instance, declare that the post of the Director of Indigenous Medicines shall be reserved for candidates belonging to scheduled castes. The Directorate is a para- medical service with Director as its head and the three Deputy Directors belonging to three distinct and separate disciplines viz. Homeopathic, Unani and Ayurvedic under him. In the para-medical system the three posts of Deputy Directors pertain to three distinct systems and therefore each of them is an isolated post by itself. The same principle should, we think, as in the case of the Director, apply. It is a moot point whether the isolated posts like those of the Deputy Directors can be subjected to the 50 point roster by the rotational system. We refrain from expressing any opinion on this aspect, as it does not arise in the present case. Assuming that the 50 point roster applies, admittedly, the first vacancy in the cadre of Deputy Directors was that of the Deputy Director (Homeopathic) and it had to be treated as unreserved, the second reserved and the third unreserved. The first vacancy of the Deputy Director (Homeopathic) in the cadre being treated as unreserved according to the roster, had to be thrown open to all. A candidate belonging to the scheduled caste had therefore to compete with others. There is another aspect. The three posts of Deputy Directors of Homeopathic, Unani and Ayurvedic are distinct and separate as they pertain to different disciplines and each one is isolated post by itselfcarried in the same cadre. There can be no grouping of isolated posts even if they are carried on the same scale. The instructions issued by the Government of India from time to time relating to reservations of posts and appointments for the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes are contained in the Brochure on Reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in Service. Chapter 2 Part I gives the percentage of reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which, in the opinion of the State, is not adequately represented in the services under the State. These instructions have been issued to carry out the mandate of article 16(4) consistent with the equality clause under article 16(1) and 16(2) and the requirements of article 335, namely, the maintenance of efficiency of administration. Para 2.4 provides that the reservations will be applied to each grade or post separately but isolated posts will be grouped as provided in Chapter 6. Paragraph 6.1 of Chapter 6 which is relevant for our purposes, states that in the case where the posts are filled by direct recruitment, 'isolated individual posts and small cadres may be grouped with posts in the same class for purpose of reservation, taking into account the status, salary and qualifications prescribed for-the posts in question'. For this purpose, it provides that a cadre or a grade or a division of a service consisting of less than 20 posts may be treated as a small cadre. A group so formed should not ordinarily consist of 25 posts. It then adds: \"It is not intended that isolated posts should be grouped together only with other isolated posts. \" That precisely is the situation here. The Government of India instructions clearly show that there can be no grouping of one or more isolated posts for purposes of reservation. To illustrate, Professors in medical colleges are carried on the same grade or scale of pay but the posts of Professor of Cardiology, Professor of Surgery, Professor of Gynaecology pertain to particular disciplines and therefore each is an isolated post. We are not aware of any decision of this Court where excessive reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens to the extent of 100% has been upheld, except in the application of the carry forward rule. article 16(4) is an exception to article 16(1) and Art. 16(2) and therefore the power to make a special provision for reservation of posts and appointments in favour of the backward classes must not be so excessive which would in effect efface the guarantee of equal opportunity in the matter of public employment or at bestmake it illusory. In Balaji's case which has now become locus classicus on the subject, the Court attempted to impose a constitutional limit to the extent of preference, not on 'narrower ground of reservation' but on broader grounds of policy. It spoke of 'adjusting' the 'interests of the weaker sections of society to the interests of the community as a whole' and declared that a 'formula must be evolved which would strike a reasonable balance between the several relevant considerations'. While striking down as unconstitutional government order by which 68% of the seats in educational institutions were reserved for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other Backward Classes on the ground of excessive reservation and as a fraud on the Constitution, the Court observed: \"Speaking generally and in a broad way, a special provision should be less than 50 per cent; how much less than 50 per cent would depend upon the relevant prevailing circumstances in each case.\" It is quite obvious that the observations in Balaji about 50% limit were not to be taken as a precise formula. In less than a year, the Court in T. Devadasan v. Union of India & ANR , [1964] 4 SCR 680 while dealing with the effect of a carry forward rule which permitted reservation of over 50% posts (in the third year) held that reservation of 64.4% posts was unconstitutional. The Court by a majority of 4: 1 held that article 16(4) was a proviso or an exception to article 16(1) and therefore should not be interpreted so as to nullify or destroy the main provision, as otherwise it would in effect render the guarantee of equality of opportunity in the matter of public employment under article 16(1) wholly illusory and meaningless, and added: \"The overriding effect of clause (4) of article 16 on cls. (1) and (2) could only extend to the making of a reasonable number of reservations of appointments and posts in certain circumstances. A 'reasonable number' is one which & strikes a reasonable balance between the claims of the backward classes and those of other citizens \" Thus, reservations are legitimate to the extent that they provide the backward classes with an 'opportunity equal to that of members of the more advanced classes'. The maximum permissible limit for the backward classes, according to the majority in Devadasan's case, is thatunder which both they and others would enjoy 'equal opportunity'. The Court further added that the reservation for backward communities should not be so excessive as to create a monopoly or unduly disturb the legitimate claims of other communities.In State af Kerala & ANR v. N.M. Thomas & ORS , [1976] 1 SCR 906 the majority accepted the dissenting opinion of Subba Rao, J. in Devadasan's case and held that article 16(4) is not an exception to article 16(1), but is a legislative device by which the framers of the Constitution have preserved a power untrammelled by the other provisions of the Article. It is a facet of article 16(1) as it fosters and furthers the idea of equality of opportunity with special reference to under-privileged and deprived classes of citizens. In his dissenting opinion, Khanna, J. speaking for himself and A.C. Gupta, J. adhered to the majority view in Devadasan's case that article 16(4) was an exception to article 16(1) and (2). According to the learned Judges, article 16(1) only embodies the notion of formal or legal equality and therefore there is no scope for spelling out any concept of preferential treatment from the language of cl.(1) of article 16. In Thomas, the Court upheld reservation to the extent of 68% on the basis of a carry forward rule which related to Class III posts and allowed relaxation to the scheduled caste candidates from appearing in the examination for promotion. What is of significance is that Krishna Iyer, J. who formed the majority in Thomas, has gone back upon his view in Akhil Bharatiya Soshit Karamchari Snagh(Railway) v. Union of India & ors., [1981] 2 SCR 185, and held that article 16(4) is an exception to article 16(1) and (2). While considering whether scheduled castes or scheduled tribes were already duly represented or not in specific cadres of the service, the Court reaffirmed the principle of reservation of appointments or posts under article 16(4) and upheld the carry forward rule. It was emphasised that what had to be seen was the overall picture and not restricted to a particular service or cadre. The maximum of 50% for reserved quotas in their totality was held to be fair and reasonable. Chinnappa Reddy, J. in his concurring judgment observed: \"(W)hen posts whether at the stage of initial appointment or at the stage of promotion are reserved or other preferential treatment is accorded to members of the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other socially and economically backward classes it is not a concession or privilege extended to them; it is in recognition of their undoubted Fundamental Right to Equality of opportunity and in discharge of the Constitutional obligation imposed upon the State to secure to all its citizens 'Justice, social, economic and political', and 'Equality of status and opportunity', to assure 'the dignity of the individual among all citizens; to 'promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker section of the people', to ensure their participation on equal basis in the administration of the affairs of the country and generally to foster the ideal of a 'Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic Republic'. Every lawful method is permissible to secure the due re presentation of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Public Services. There is no fixed ceiling to reservation or preferential treatment in favour of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes though generally reservation may not be far in excess of fifty per cent.\" It follows that though the maximum limit of 50% as indicated was not an inflexible rule but in making special provision for reservation of posts or appointments, the State must seek to strike a balance of adjusting the interests of the weaker sections of society to the interests of the community as a whole. In State of Maharashtra v. Shivaji Y. Garge C.A. number 4117/84 decided on 19th October, 1984 this Court held the reservation of posts to the extent of 80% as excessive and destructive of the principle of equality of opportunity in matters relating to public employment guaranteed under article 16(1) of the Constitution and directed that the State Government would step down the reservation for economically weaker sections of the society from 46% to 21% in future, leaving in tact 34% posts reserved for scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, denotified nomadic tribes and other backward classes. Thus, the overall picture was that reservation of posts and appointments under article 16(1) was reduced from 80% to 55%. Once the power to make reservation in favour of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes is exercised, it must necessarily follow that a roster pointwise for the purpose of vacancies for which reservation has been made, must be brought into effect and in order to do full justice, a carry forward rule must be so applied that in any particular year, there is not more than 50% reservation. According to the SO point roster, admittedly, the post of Deputy Director (Homeopathic) was the first vacancy in the cadre of Deputy Directors and therefore it had to be treated as general i.e. unreserved. In the recent case of KC. Vasanth Kumar & ANR v. State of Karnataka, [1985] Suppl. SCC 714, one of us (Sen, J.) dealing with theextent of reservation under article 15(4) and article 16(4), observed that the doctrine of protective discrimination embodied therein and the mandate of article 29(2) was subject to the requirements of article 335 and could not be stretched beyond a particular limit. It was observed: \"Questions as to the validity or otherwise of reservations have been agitated several times before this Court and resolved. The frequency and vigour with which these questions are raised is a disturbing indication of the tension and unease in society in regard to the manner in which Art. 15(4) and article 16(4) are operated by the State. The Preamble to our Constitution shows the nation's resolve to secure to all its citizens: Justice-social, economic and political. The State's objective of bringing about and maintaining social justice must be achieved reasonably having regard to the interests of all. Irrational and unreasonable moves by the State will slowly but surely tear apart the fabric of society. It is primarily the duty and function of the State to inject moderation into the decisions taken under articles 15(4) and 16(4), because justice lives in the hearts of men and a growing sense of injustice and reverse discrimination, fuelled by unwise State action, will destroy, not advance, social justice. If the State contravenes the constitutional mandates of article 16(1) and Art. 335, this Court will of course, have to perform its duty.\" A note of caution was then added: \"The State exists to serve its people. There are some services where expertise and skill are of the essence. For example, a hospital run by the State serves the ailing members of the public who need medical aid. Medical services directly affect and deal with the health and life of the populace. Professional expertise, born of knowledge and experience, of a high degree of technical knowledge and operational skill is required of pilots and aviation engineers. The lives of citizens depend on such persons. There are other similar fields of governmental activity where professional, technological, scientific or other special skill is called for. In such services or posts under the Union or States, we think there can be no room for reservation of posts; merit alone must be the sole and decisive consideration for appointments.\" There is one more decision that calls for our attention, namely, that of Arati Ray Choudhury v. Union of India & ORS , [1974] 1 SCR 1 where the effect of a carry forward rule resulted in 100% reservation. After the decision in Devadasan's case, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued a memorandum modifying the carry forward rule so as to com ply with the decision. The said memorandum was suitably modified by the Railway Board in its application to Railway Services by its letter dated 6th October, 1964. The Railway Board prepared a model roster signifying the turns of reserved and unreserved vacancies. The Note appended to the roster provided: \"If there are only two vacancies to be filled on a particular occasion, not more that one may be treated as reserved and if there be only one vacancy, it should be treated as unreserved. If on this account a reserved point is treated as unreserved, the reservation may be carried forward in the subsequent two recruitment years.\" In order to minimise chances of reserved posts being converted into unreserved posts, the Railway Board modified the reservation rule in 1971 by adding the following words: \"If there is one post to be filled, selection should invariably be held for two posts, i.e., one actual and the other to cover unforseen circumstances.\" It was contended on behalf of the petitioner that the carry forward rule was violative of articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution and the vacancy in the post of Headmistress of the Kharagpur School ought to be treated as unreserved vacancy. In repelling the contention, Chandrachud, J. observed: \"The model roster accompanying the letter of the Railway Board dated January 16, 1964 is designed to meet the requirements of the new situation arising out of the rules framed in deference to the judgment in Devadasan's case. Both the letter and the Note appended to the roster state expressly that if \"there are only two vacancies to be filled on a particular occasion, not more than one may be treated as reserved and if there be only one vacancy, it should be treated as unreserved\". The words \"on a particular occasion\" were substituted on September 2, 1964 by the words \"year of recruitment\". Thus, in the first place each year of recruitment is directed to be considered separately and by itself as laid down in Devadasan's case so that if there are only two vacancies to be filled in a particular year of recruitment, not more than one vacancy can be treated as reserved. Secondly, and that is directly relevant for our purpose, if there be only one vacancy to be filled in a given year of recruitment, it has to be treated as unreserved irrespective of whether it occurs in the model roster at a reserved point. The appointment then is not open to the charge that the reservation exceeds 50% for, if the very first vacancy in the first year of recruitment is in practice treated as reserved vacancy, the system may be open to the objection that the reservation not only exceeds 50% but is in fact cent per cent. But if \"on this account\", that is to say, if on account of the requirement that the first vacancy must in practice be treated as unreserved even if it occurs in the model roster at a reserved point,\"a reserved point is treated as unreserved\", the reservation can be carried forward to not more than two subsequent years of recruitment. Thus, if two vacancies occur, say, within an initial span of three years, the first vacancy has to be treated as an unreserved vacancy and the second as reserved.\" The learned Judge held that the open class reaped a benefit in 1966-67 when a reserved vacancy was treated as unreserved by the appointment of an open candidate, Shrimati Gita Biswas. If the carry forward rule had to be given any meaning, the vacancy had to be carried forward for the benefit of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes until the close of the financial year 1968-69. The Kharagpur vacancy could not therefore go to the petitioner which, admittedly, did not belong to the reserved class. It was further observed that the construction sought to be put on the rule by the petitioner would perpetuate a social injustice which has clouded the lives of a large section of humanity which is struggling to find its feet. Such a construction was contrary to the plain language of the letter of the Railway Board, the intendment of the rule and its legislative history. The decision in Arati Ray Choudhury's case therefore turned on the carry forward rule and is clearly distinguishable on facts It is quite clear after the decision in Devadasan's case that no reservation could be made under article 16(4) so as to create a monopoly. Otherwise, it would render the guarantee of equal opportunity contained in articles 16(1) and 16(2) wholly meaningless and illusory. These principles unmistakably lead us to the conclusion that if there is only one post in the cadre, there can be no reservation with reference to that post either for recruitment at the initial stage or for filling up a future vacancy in respect of that post. A reservation which would come under article 16(4), pre-supposes the availability of at least more than one posts in that cadre. We would, for these reasons, uphold the judgment of the High Court quashing the impugned advertisement issued by the Bihar Public Service Commission as also the appointment of the appellant to the post of Deputy Director (Homeopathic). We direct the Public Service Commission to take steps to re- advertise the post with advertence to the observations made above. However, having regard to the fact that the appellant has continued to hold that post ever since 30th May, 1979 and confirmed against that post, we direct the State Government to adjust him in an equivalent post in the Health Department. At the time of his appointment, the appellant was Medical officer (Homeo) of Government Homeopathic Dispensary, Raharia (Saharsa) and his appointment to the higher grade of Deputy Director (Homeopathic) in the directorate of Indigenous Medicines was virtually a promotion for him. This may be kept in view by the Government while passing suitable orders. There shall be no order as to costs. H.S.K.
